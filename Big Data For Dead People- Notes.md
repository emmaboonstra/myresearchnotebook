hitchcock tim digital resource notes

These are some summary notes about Hitchcock's article, "Big Data for Dead People"

Digital resources have profoundly changed the way we think about the past, it forces us to rethink certain disciplines

Hitchcock talks about an example of the mass consumption of words and text with the help of technology. Schmit analyses Mad Men and compares scriptwriters from the show versus a text published. He is able to make great comparasions and analyses about gender, masculinity, and the differences between the two. 

Hitchcock stresses that the existence of Google books for example, is something that Schmidt relied heavily upon 

Using graphs,grams and other digital technology allows scholars to re-examine texts. 

Hitchcock suggests almost a hybrid in terms of dealing with material: instead of using new technology with the "same old stuff", what if people were to find a new perspective? with the availibiility of material and texts, it gives us the chance to change the perspective from white western men(these people dominate history)

He talks about Sarah Durrant, just a "normal" ordinary women from the 19th century. She took two bank notes from the floor of a coffee house and pocketed them. Using technology from a modern viewpoint, rather than giving her the same narrative of "thief" because of lack of knowledge, we can use the transcripts of her trial and her (powerful)portrait and personality to give her a narrative and voice that was not possible before. From all this info we can cross-analyze info about Sarah that suggests she was from a certain class and or age grouping. 

Using all the info from modern research, taking clippings from newspapers and texts from maps and articles, we can find out where Sarah lived and nearly everything about this woman. 

Even further, we can use tools like linguistics to look at her case in terms of her trial. 

Insanely enough, we can go further with technology. Hitchcock explains how we are now able to "contextualise Sarah's experience among that of 240,000 defendants like her."

overall, we can see that using NEW technologies can provide even more in depth knowledge but furthermore using digital history we can get a sea of information that can even provide narratives and insights into historical periods that have not even been touched yet. Sarah, for example, is just an example of how using technology we can give voice to the voiceless but furthermore give insight and perspective into history. 

One quote that really struck me as important: "there seems to be a real tension between the desire on the one hand to include the 'reading' of a whole new variety of data in to the process of writing history; and, on the other, the extent to which each attempt to do so, tends to brin gto the fore a form of understanding that is at odds with much of the scholarshp of the last forty years." 
	Hitchcock talks about how this reivents the problem and rather causes society to ask questions they know computers can answer. 
	
The bottom line is that you are re-opening issues that were thought to be closed.
