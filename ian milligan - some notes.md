digitized newspaper online resources

Using newspaper databases like the Star and Globe carefully because not all information is found in context. Milligan makes the example of how a small chunk of info was found in a search, however with some digging it was actually a continuance of an article from another page with a headline. You miss the whole story essentially

OCR - optical character recognition -- technology that allows you to change hand written or physical text into printed digital text

hitchcock : "uncritical use of digitized sources as 'roulette dressed up as scholarship' as historicans are 'not even bothering to apply the kind of critical approach that historians built their profession authority upon.'" 

Research may seem easier, however the same about of analysis and critical approach is not being applied to this research -- don't rely on databases without critical reflection

Biggest point from the article: when you look at texts and articles from a time period from a database, be thinking is this everything? did I get all the information? is this from every angle possible? 
missing information changes things drastically.
