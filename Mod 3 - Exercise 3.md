Open Refine

So, just to start off -- download the older version of Open Refine. I read somewhere that you needed to update Java to fix this:  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions
But even after doing this I downloaded Open Refine but it would not work. The application opened but with no start up page or anything, just running but with no program. I looked on Slack and someone suggested using the older version because this worked for them. When I downloaded the old version, it directed me install a DIFFERENT version of java than I had previously downloaded. Wowza, going in circles here trying to set this up but luckily -- eventually -- I got to the installation process of Open(or Google) Refine.

Once I got started, I opened the file and unfortunately I didn't have the correct columns; I'm assuming this means I didn't do everything correctly in cleaning up the details in my cleaned-correspondence file. I went back, and tried to clean up things again.
Here you can see the problem I encountered:

Upon looking at the instructions, I realized I had completely forgot one step, I must've been so into the whole process that I didn't change the "to" into "," in exercise two. Then, when I looked for the errors there were obviously a lot more so I fixed that as well!

Now, when I opened the cvs it looked a million times better -- and by that, I mean it looked correct. But upon closer inspection, I noticed that mine didn't say "sender" and recipient" -- but I could gather that the far left was sender and the middle was recipient and continued from there.

Then, I clustered both of these categories -- I had only a few names that were messed up because I had spent so much time cleaning things up in TextWrangler (I wanted to make sure there wasn't a lot of errors!)

I followed the instructions and exported, now I have a ready-to-use csv file on my desktop! Success! (I feel like this is becoming a habit -- at the end of each exercise I say this, hahah.)
