Mapping Texts Project
http://mappingtexts.stanford.edu/whitepaper/MappingTexts_WhitePaper.pdf

There is so much to do with the data and in our day and age. So much archival and historical documents out there -- but how do we really engage with all this material in a meaningful way? This project suggests that there are way more effective methods for going through historical data -- like collections of newspapers, historical records, etc. There are two may ways: using text mining, or visualizing patterns through geospatial mapping. The Mapping Texts project in particular delt with large-scale collections, so lots and lots of data, and then combinging text-mining w/ visualization to create something that is understandable, thoughtful, and visually appealing to an audience - this means that it's easy to digest and comphrehend. Overall, it seems to be that the digital aspects of using data seem to create insights that could not otherwise be seen. 

The interactive visualizations on their project page are extremely insightful and a cool way of presenting information and research. I did some browsing here:

History in the City - Michelle Moravec 
http://historyinthecity.blogspot.ca/2013/12/corpus-linguistics-for-historians.html

From what I gather from Moravec's post, Coprus Linguistics is analyzing language in a particular body of text  -- in terms of digitial linguistics(computers)  -- it seems as though computers look for relationships between words in a mathematical sense. Like patterns. 
Moravec says: 
"Machine reading of sources provides two advantages for the historian 
1.  Machines can deal with far larger volume of source material than the human brain can, anything from hundred to hundreds of thousands 
2.  Machines can find patterns and relationships that the human brain cannot. "

I found this to be particularly insightful. As I mentioned earlier, we live in a day where everything is textual. Not only this, but there is so much information -- so much material and data that we cannot physically deal with by ourselves. This is where computers, digital tools come into handy. To me, it seems as though historians need to start using these resources to have more accurate research. Not only this, but using digital tools -- like corpus linguistics software -- can give insight into certain data that would not be physically possible without. 

Scott Weigngart -- Network Analysis

Our world is so connected. Networks, as Weigngart says: "open up the world." Science and technology allow for us to create this foundation for our underlying networks. It allows us to connect, and whether we like it or not, in this texual world. On a larger level, having these networks means that we can also analyze the relationships between them. 

Topic Modeling

I originally read this which was included in the workbook, but I found it a little difficult to follow because it was so short(but the visual representations were great and helpful!)

 So, I read this article as well and it really helped my understanding of it: http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/

Topic modelling is essentially a form of text mining, and a technique for organizing and visually identifying patterns in a large text or collection of texts(or if we're getting fancy, "corpus.") As Brett says, it's determined by mathematics. For someone in history or humanities, it is clear that topic modelling could prove useful in many aspects. If you wanted to see the change in a certain topic over time in newspapers, you could look at data in an entire collection over time using this tool. Physically, this could take years to process, but with the help of topic modelling, the patterns would be at your disposal. 



Reading about visualizing data, topic modelling, and looking at project dealing with this sort of text mining/visualization has got my gears turning about my final project. I'm really interested in so many things, so I've changed my mind so many times, but I think I would like to look at the American housewife in the 1960s. I could do topic modelling of woman's narratives in terms of popular topics and themes, but then also analyze data in newspapers for the content about women in the 1960s.
