syncing issues github repository branches

In making my research notebook for class, made some errors along the way. I accidentally made a branch called "emmaboonstra-mynotebook" which was causing some issues!

I merged this to my main branch, "master" and it seemed to fix the problem for one part. As you can see here, there's 2 branches:

But I still didn't understand how to sync. Went to slack for some help and found out that I need to clone the repo onto my computer, then connect this repo by opening it up into the GitHub Desktop app!

I ended taking a slightly easier route. As pictured below, you can see that I ended up going on the GitHub website and clicked this button here which auto-prompted GitHub to set up the repo.
