I don't think the site is a trustworthy provider of historical texts because it does not include full accurate texts but rather clips and portions of texts in which the editor or creator of the website has chosen. It seems as though this cutting and clipping of information changes the way a reader sees the informations and how they understand it. It's not accurate. 

I chose page 53 of the primary source and then I got straight to it. I opened the blanktemplate.txt into atom and started writing out the page (which took a little longer than I thought it would just because I wanted it to be spot on.)

After this, I started to highlight some things in the text. I didn't really have that much interesting information in here in terms of claims, people(notable, findable people), or places other than Georgia, which I assumed was Georgia, US. I looked up the coordinates and then linked to this.

Next, I had to download and install firefox(cries) because I use chrome. While it installed/downloaded, I made myself a cuppa tea and also made a small wish that the file would be all nicely coloured the first time I dragged it into firefox. 

Of course, it didn't work. I also mess up the first time round, but oh well -- learning experience! 

So, to isolate the issue, I first went in and took out my annotation, which was Georgia:

Then, when I put it into firefox without my annotation, it worked like a charm:

So from here, I knew something went wrong when I tried to add in some notes. So I went back and tried again. I tried instead with a person mentioned in the text, "Mr. Cooper" -- I had orginally avoided the person because I had no idea really of finding out who he was. But for the purpose of the exercise I tried, putting the code into atom and saving again -- then dragging to firefox. This time, it worked! Woohoo:

As you can see this time, "Mr. Cooper" is lit up in blue. Success!
