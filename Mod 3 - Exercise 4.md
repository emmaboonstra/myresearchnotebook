I just downloaded NER and I opened the file "ner-gui.command."

Unfortunately on first go, it didn't open two windows, as it should've -- I needed to download another version of Java to make this happen. So I downloaded Java 8, installed it, and then tried again - both the windows opened!

Then, I opened my original texan-correspondence.txt and deleted the extra information we were working with before, so instead I was left with the actual letters.

I then opened the text into the SER. Then I clicked classifier, and opened the classifier. Then, I clicked "Run NER."
This where I was a little nervous, because the fans on my Mac went nuts. It was really working hard. I closed a bunch of excess programs to let the program do its thing. Nothing really happened for a while. It looked like this:

Then, it seemed to have conjured something up, because it was working away in terminal:

Thing is, the text didn't seem to have any colouring as it should've. I realized that I got the error messsage: "OutofMemory Error: Java heap space" which means I have waaay too much text to process. I shortened the excerpt by a lot to help the machine out. 

Then it looked like it was running -- it started going through people and organization and location. It was working away, moving very fast.

Tada! And then, once it finished(with no problem this time) the document was coloured.

I copied the data from terminal into TextWrangler and saved it!

Success!
