This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe. 

About Google Book Search 

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and to make it universally accessible and useful. Google Book Search helps readers 
discover the world's books while helping authors and publishers reach new audiences. You can search through the full text of this book on the web

rN-TEODUOTIOK 

In editing Part II of the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Republic 
of Texas, the same difficulties which appeared in deaUng with Part 
I have manifested themselves with much greater intensity, and 
to them have been added some new ones. The effort to restore 
the original grouping has been especially difficult. In the files, 
inclosures have generally been found separate from the letters with 
which they were transmitted and placed in order of dates-; and, in 
the records, though they frequently indicate the arrangement of the 
communications and other matter as sent or received, there is some- 
times such confusion that they become utterly useless for the pur- 
pose. Besides this, some of the letters received, both those sent 
independently and those inclosed with others, have been taken out 
of the "diplomatic" correspondence and filed with other series in 
the archives, such as *' colonization," "financial affairs," "army 
papers," etc.; and the task of discovering them and returning them 
to their places in the correspondence has not been easy. It is hoped, 
however, that, while a httle doubt remains in some cases, the endeavor 
to restore the original arrangement has been fairly successful. 

The principal aim, both in the arrangement of the letters and in 
the annotations, has been to throw as much light as possible on the 
internal relations of the Correspondence. In this way, it is believed, 
will the publication of it be given the highest degree of value for 
the investigator. The external relations, which can be so much 
more easily worked out by readers unable to reach the Texan archives 
but with fair library facilities available, have received much less 
attention. 

Part n has been a little more liberally edited than Part I. Errors 
in the original documents that are evidently the result of pure 
inadvertence have been corrected, with notes where they have 
seemed important enough to call for it, but frequently without. 
The supposition of inadvertence in the case of errors in the use of 
French and Spanish accents has been made wherever there seemed to 
be room for it. But errors in this respect or any other that appear 
to be habitual or due to want of information have, as a general 
rule, been reproduced, or corrected only with annotations. More 
freedom has been used in editing copies that there is reason to sus- 
pect as corrupt than originals and copies that appear to be trust- 
worthy.

30 INTRODUCTION. 

The classification of the correspondence has been by subject 
matter rather than by the diplomatic office or location of the writer. 
Letters dealing with Spanish relations, for example, are placed 
in the correspondence with Spain, even though written by or to the 
Texan charge to Great Britain and France. 

The system of reference for inclosures, leading from the title 
to the letter with which the inclosure came, and thence sometimes 
to the calendar or another division of the correspondence, may 
now and then try the patience of the reader; but it has been adopted 
as that which will throw the clearest light on the history and the 
relations of each letter. 

Before reaching final conclusions in the study of Part I, the reader 
should compare the corrections and further annotations and the list 
of addenda for Part I given in Part II. 

The diplomatic relations of Texas with the European powers 
began in 1837, with the sending of J. Pinckney Henderson on a mis- 
sion to Great Britain and France. He had letters of credence both 
as agent and as minister plenipotentiary to Great Britain, and pre- 
sumably also to France.** He reached London in October. The 
efforts to establish relations with Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
the Hanse Towns, and Prussia were made partly by the ministers in 
Great Britain and France, and partly by special chargfe. May 20, 
1839, James Hamilton was sent to act as joint agent of Texas with 
Henderson, both in England and France, and on April 18, 1840, he 
was appointed Texan diplomatic commissioner to the Netherlands, 
and at the same time received a second commission empowering him 
to treat with both the Netherlands and Belgium. January 20, 1843, 
William H. Daingerfield was commissioned as charg6 d'affaires to 
the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Hanse Towns. While on his mis- 
sion he visited Vienna and Berlin also, and, in fact, undertook some 
correspondence to ascertain through official sources the attitude 
of Prussia towards Texas. In 1842, Ashbel Smith, then chargfi 
d'affaires to Great Britain and France, tried to open the way for 
formal negotiations with Spain by a correspondence with General 
Sancho, Spanish minister to Great Britain, and Washington Irving, 
United States minister to Spain, but nothing came of it; nor did 
Smith nor George W. Terrell, who was commissioned as Texan 
minister to Spain in 1846, visit Madrid at all. 

Strenuous efforts were made by the Texan government during 
Lamar's administration to estabUsh amicable relations with Mexico. 
On February 20, 1839, Barnard E. Bee was commissioned both as 
agent and as minister plenipotentiary of Texas to Mexico. He went 
toVeraCmz in May; but the Mexican government refused to receive 

a No copies of his letters of credence to France have been found, but they doubtless had the same fbnn 
as those to Great Britain.

him, and he got no further. On August 9, of the same year, James 
Treat was appointed private and confidential agent of Texas to 
Mexico. He reached Mexico in December, 183^, and remained until 
November, 1840. On March 20, 1841, James Webb received com- 
missions similar to those which had been given to Bee. He went 
to Vera Cruz in May, but was not allowed to proceed to Mexico. 

On July 20, 1841, President Lamar wrote the governor of Yucat&n, 
which was then in a state of insurrection against the central govern- 
ment of Mexico, inviting him to send an agent to Texas with a view 
to the establishment of relations of amity and commerce between the 
two countries. The result was a sort of miUtary convention by 
which the fleet of Texas was subsidized to operate against Mexico on 
behalf of both Texas and Yucat4n, but no treaty was concluded. 

First after the United States to accord recognition to the RepubUc 
of Texas was France. This was done by a treaty of amity, commerce, 
and navigation concluded September 26, 1839, and ratified February 
14, 1840. A similar treaty between Great Britain and Texas was 
signed November 13, 1840; a convention for British mediation 
between Mexico and Texas, on November 14; and a treaty for the sup- 
pression of the African slave trade, on November 16. For reasons 
which need not be detailed here, the ratifications of these three 
treaties were not exchanged till June 28, 1842. A commercial treaty 
with the Netherlands was signed September 18, 1840, and ratified 
June 15, 1841. A convention of amity, commerce, and navigation 
with the Ilanse Towns was concluded April 17, 1844, and was later 
ratified by the Senate of Bremen; but, doubtless b^ause of the near 
prospect of annexation, it seems never to have been acted on by the 
Senate of Texas. No treaty was concluded with Spain or Belgium. 
In April, 1838, before Texas was formally recognized, an agreement 
was effected with the British Government whereby Texan vessels 
were admitted to the ports of Great Britain as those of Mexico; and a 
resolution adopted by the senate of Bremen on August 9, 1843, pro- 
vided for the admission of Texan vessels to the ports of Bremen on 
the same terms as to port charges and duties as the ships of Bremen 
on condition of a reciprocal arrangement by Texas. 

Of course, until the ratification of the various treaties mentioned, 
the negotiations with the countries with which they were made was 
on a more or less informal basis. Aft^ those with Great Britain 
and France were ratified, charges were sent to Texas by both these 
nations; but no other had a diplomatic representative to that repub- 
Uc at any time.** The only charg6 sent by Great Britain was Charles 
EUiot, whose letter of credence was dated June 28, 1842, and who 

« There is good reason to believe that Mr. 7. T. Crawford, who visited Texas in April, 1837, came as a secret 
agent of Qieat Britain to report on its civil and political condition. Count de Saligny undertook a similar 
mission for France early in 1839, and Capt. Victor Pirson came openly as the agent of Belgium in 1842. 
None of these, however, appears to have had any dlplomatlo authority.

reached Texas in August, and remained till the eve of annexation. 
The first charge of France was Count A. de Saligny,** who was accred- 
ited October 2, 1839, and reached Texas m February, 1840. He 
left Texas in March, 1841, but returned for a brief period in 1842. 
Towards the end of that year, he was succeeded by "Viscount J. de 
Cramayel. Some two years later, Cramayel left Texas and Saligny 
returned. This time he continued in the capacity of charg6 until the 
mission was ended by annexation. 

The letters printed in Part II have been taken mainly from the 
file of originals received and copies kept of letters sent from Texas, 
and from the transcripts in the books of the Department of State. 
Book 55, from which some of them were obtained, is evidently the 
original kept by Daingerfield for his missions to the Netherlands, 
Belgium, and the Hanse Towns. It is, however, the only book from 
any of the Eiuropean legations that has been found in the Texan 
archives. That it was brought to Texas and delivered to the Secre- 
tary of State is shown by the letter of Daingerfield to Allen, February 
2, 1846; and its contents place its identity beyond question. 

Just as this part was ready, as the editor thought, to send to press, 
a considerable mass of the correspondence was found in books which 
had not been suspected of containing it. The reasons why it had 
escaped discovery are that the mass of matter in the books is so great 
and the indexes so imperfect. The indexes are, in fact — ^where they 
exist at all — often worse than useless, in that they are misleading. 
Many of the letters in the newly discovered group belong to the 
period of Correspondence with the United States covered by Part I. 
They make it possible, in some cases and to a certain extent, to fdi- 
low both sides of the correspondence where the letters already pub- 
lished had given but one. While the editor does not feel absolutely 
certain that some letters may not still Kave evaded his search, 
he hopes that little of importance preserved in the Texan archives 
and properly to be included in the correspondence now remains 
impublished. 

The editor is under special obligations to State Librarian E. W. 
Winkler, who several years ago gave the Correspondence here printed 
its first approach toward rational and useful arrangement, and con- 
sequent availability for the student. Mr. Winkler's minute knowl- 
edge of the Texan archives and of southwestern history in general 
have made his freely rendered assistance of the highest value. Grate- 
ful acknowledgment is made also to instructors Walton H. Hamilton 
and J. L. Worley, of the University of Texas, for help in verifying 
and arranging the copies; to Profs. Lilia M. Casls and E. J. Villavaso, 
also of this university, for verifying, respectively, the Spanish and 

o Thus written by himself. The name is usually given in official documents fmanating trom the Freocli 
Government as "Dubois de Saligny."

Garrison died in July, 1910, before reading a single page of the proof 
of this second part of the "Diplomatic Correspondence of Texas." 
The labor of proof-reading, therefore, fell upon others, who did not 
possess the special knowledge, experience, and full equipment enjoyed 
by him. This has occasioned some delay, and may have resulted in 
some inaccuracy. 

Professor Garrison had for years been preparing the material for 
these volumes, and, fortunately, left it in very good shape for pub- 
lication. So far as the collation of the text is concerned, he gave 
assurances of completeness and accuracy. The list of material 
already published was prepared by him, and he left, to be used with 
the documents as they were published, notes explaining and illus- 
trating the subject. These have been inserted in the places desig- 
nated by him. The volume practically stands as his labor. 

The proof-reading has been done by Miss Catharine Bowes, Miss 
Georgia Sanderlin, and Miss Bertha M. Emerson. The Commission 
acknowledges the courteous assistance of Professor Eugene C. Barker^ 
of the University of Texas.

changes in the appointments of Commissioner and Surveyor on the 
part of this Government to run and mark the boundary line betwe^i 
the United States and Texas, have been made, and to request that 
you will give notice thereof to the Government of the United States. 

In the place of Branch T. Archer Esqr (of whose appointment as 
Conunissioner you were notified on the 3d Jime last, and who from 
private considerations has since been compelled to decline acting) 
the Honl. Isaac N. Jones has been appointed, and in the place of C. 
R Johns Esqr.tieorge W. Smyth Esqr has been appointed Surveyor. 

As circumstances not now foreseen may prevent the attendance of 
one or both of these Gentlemen at New Orleans on the day appointed 
for the meeting of the Commissioners, and to avoid any disappoint- 
ment or delay on the part of this Government in causing the line to be 
run, David Sample Esqr has been duly authorized to act as commis- 
sioner in the place of Doct Jones, should the latter GrentlemMi not 
attend, and if neither of them attend, then Lieut Col. Peter B. Dexter 
of the Texian Army will be authorized to act, and in the event of the 
failure of the Surveyor to attend, the Commissioner will be authorized

Sir, 

I have the pleasure to acknowledge several communications from 
you recently, and one from Mr Roberts of the 2d Inst. ^ enclosing copy 
of a communication from Mr Poinsett Secretary of War to yourself. . 

I regret to observe that Mr Poinsett seems to restjrict the obliga- 
tions of the United States growing out of the treaty with Mexico, to 
Indians resident within the United States. The prevention of any 
encroachments upon our territory from such Indians is certainly very 
desirable on our part, and manifestly incumbent on that of the Gov- 
ernment of the United States. But there is another description of 
Indians whose annoyances are equally intolerable to us and who are 
equally within the perview of the treaty stipulations. The band of 
Cherokees lately under the Chieftainship of the notorious Bowls* 
have been resident for some years in Texas, but they are orijginally' 
Indians of the United States, and having been unwelcome intruders 
here, have never lost their American character, nor acquired social or 
political rights here. They are clearly the legitimate subjects of the 

a There was an extensive correspondence between the oommlssioners of the United States and those of 
Texas, and between the Texan government and Its commissioner, part of which has been published In 
Sinate Doa., 27th Cong., 2d Sess., Ill (Serial No. 397), Doc. 199, and Howe Docs. 27th Cong., 2d Sess. n 
(Serial No. 402), Doc. 51, and more is copied in Records of the Department of State (Texas), Book 51. The 
main question raised in this correspondence, namely, whether the mouth of the Sabine should be inter- 
preted to mean the point where the river enters Sabine Lake or the point where the lake debouches into 
the Oulf of Mexico and by consequence whether the lake should be regarded as lying wholly within the 
United states or not— is quite interesting and important; but since Forsyth refused to recognize author- 
ity of the commissionerB to deal with the question and censured Overton, the United States commissioner, 
for engaging In the discussion (see his letter, in Pub. Does., 402, cited above), and since considerations of 
gpaoe in the publication of this Correspondence are claiming attention, the series to which this note refers 
is omitted.

Treaty stipulation on the part of the United States and properly 
belong to their jurisdiction and control. 

The Caddoes are more recent intruders upon our territory and they 
commenced their hostihties before they had the audacity to pass the 
line of the United States. The Kickapoos, Shawnees, Delawares, and 
Several Minor bands of the Creek tribe are in similar circumstances, — 
and these all have combined together in depredating upon our scat- 
tered frontier famihes. 

You have probably heard of the late campaign against the Chero- 
kees and its results. It is not ascertained whether they have actually 
passed the Une of the United States or whether they have only dis- 
persed in small parties and are meditating a cruel and desultory war 
upon our borders. They have been pretty severely chastised and we 
entertain a hope that they will give us no further Molestation. If 
they shall have crossed into the United States it is important that 
some adequate steps be taken by that Government to prevent their 
returning. If they should return, it will be more than probable that 
Many of the restless spirits among the tribes lately translated to our 
vicinity will unite with them and by becoming participants in the war 
here, will eventually kindle a flame that will spread along the whole 
line of the Missouri. The death of Bowls has deprived the tribes 
resident in Texas, of their most intelligent and mischievous head, 
and has in a great measure subverted their political powers by destroy- 
ing their means of combination. Still they may be capable of inflict- 
ing grievious evils upon our frontier settlements, by desultory incur- 
sions, and it is very important that we avail ourselves of every possible 
and just method of prevention. 

The propriety of the application to the Government of the United 
States in respect to these bands, is so obvious that the President does 
not feel it needful to present any further reasons in elucidation of it. 

The Presidents health is improving. We shall shortly be busily 
employed in removing to Austin.

Sir, 

The Honl David O. Burnet Actg Secty of State being at present

cation received this day by the Honl. A. Sidney Jonston* secre-

will make its contents immediately known to the Government of

by that Government to prevent the threatened invasion of Texas 
by the Indians therein alluded to, and restrain them within their 
proper boundaries. 

That the action of the United States Government on this subject 
will be prompt the President feels the fullest confidence, from the 
repeated assurances of Mr Poinsett Secretary of War as commu-

Bztnet of a letter direeted to the Honl A Sidney J<diiifltoii Secretary of War from John Brabenoo oom- 
znanding a company of Texas Raogers dated Camp Bols d'Aic Sept 2d 1839. 

Since my last nothing of importance has transpired on this frontier, 
no sign of any Indians crossing Red River, either to or ft*om Texas 
with the exception of a small party of Pawnees a few days ago, 
on their way from Texad, to their Village on the North side of Red 
River, which party was permitted to pass unmolested, and crossed 
ihe Red River in peace and safety. This party informed us, of a 
party of Cherokees, Settled and are now remaining, on the East fork 

of the Trinity River about We will keep a close watch for 

them. 

I have just received a communication from Mr Clark Sub Agent 
for the CSioctaw Indians of the United States, which informs us that 
a party of Cherokees are now embodying on the Arkansas River 
for the purpose of invading Texas, and advising me to keep a close 
watch for them. I believe the United States Indian Agents are 
doing all in their power to prevent the Indians from crossing Red 
River to commit depredations upon our Citizens. Yet it will be 
impossible to prevent it, so long as Red River remains the dividing 
line for 200 Miles between our Settlements, and the Indians and no 
station, or Military post, at any point upon said Stream.

Charg6 d' Affaires of the United States, representing that ''another 
violation of the territory of the United States has been committed 
by a Military officer of Texas " 

The undersigned has submitted that note to the President and has 
great pleasure in reiterating to the honorable Mr La Branche his 
sentiments on the subject and to assure him that an enquiry will 
be instituted into the relative facts that the officer who may be 
found to have so transgressed, will be suitably admonished of his 
indiscretion; and that such further measures will be adopted as it 
is hoped will effectually prevent the recurrence of a similar event. 
The President is sensible of the many difficulties incident to border 
Settlements where the population of the remote frontiers of Two 
Gk)vemments are put in juxtaposition. In the present instance 
those difficulties are probably enhanced by the fact that the line of 
demarcation between the two Governments has not been definitively 
ascertained and by the consequent inability of this Government to 
perfect its domestic organization in that quarter of the Republic. 

It affords the undersigned great satisfaction to assure the Honl. 
Charg6 d' Affairs of the United States that nothing can be more 
foreign to the designs or repugnant to the wishes of the President 
and indeed of the people of Texas, than to intercept the harmony 
and good understanding which so happily subsists, and it is confi- 
dently hoped always will prevail between the two Grovernments. 

The acting Secretary of State has the honor to repeat to the 
honorable Mr La Branche assurance of his high consideration and 
Regards.

Sm, Agreeably to my promise in the conference which I had the 
honor to hold with you on yesterday, relative to the claim of Messrs 
Campbell and Dean, which was presented to this Government by 
your official letter of 18th June last, I am directed by the President 
to remark. « 

That, the (Jovemment of Texas feels itself bound to make full 
compensation for the quantity of bacon that was actually pressed 
by an officer of the Texian Army, from the possession of Mr. R. G. 
Bryerly,*' as alledged in your note, and avouched by the receipt of 
that officer. The only difficulty that intervenes an immediate set- 
tlement of this demand results from the excessive price which the 
claimants have affixed to the article. To render justice, is a common 
duty: to submit to imposition, is to sanction and reward iniquity. 
Messrs Campbell and Dean must be sensible that no instance can be 
found in this or any other country, of inferior and damaged bacon 
having been sold at two dollars per pound. On this Subject, I have 
the honor to transmit you three several letters from gentlemen of

high respectability, all of them members of the Congress of Texas. 
But as I am in expectation of further testimony on this subject, I 
would resi>ectfully suggest the propriety of deferring the discussion 
of it until more minute information can be had. 

In reference to the damages claimed, I can only remark at present, 
that the question of damages, and the amount, if any, to be allowed, 
will depend upon the circumstances of the case; and with the very 
limited intelligence we now have, it would be impossible to arrive 
at a satisfactory solution. The whole demand is so exceedingly 
exorbitant that a rigid scrutiny into the relative facts, seems to be 
indispensible to a just appreciation of it. 

I have the honor to repeat to Mr. La Branche, assurances of my 
high consideration.

Honl David G. Burnet. 

Sir, Having understood that the Honl Charg6 d'Affaires of the 
United States, near the (jovemment of the Republic of Texas, 
has claims against this Government for 10000 dollars which is 
charged by one Davis for 5000 pounds of inferior bacon pressed by 
the quarter Master of the fourth Brigade Texas Militia. Having 
been myself engaged in the sale of Bacon during the same season, 
previous to said impressment, I am enabled to say with certainty 
that at the time of tBe impressment of said bacon and previously, 
the highest price for which any was sold in the neighborhood of said 
bacon unless in very small quantities did not exceed seventeen cents 
per pound, average price from 15 to 17 cents per lb. The bacon 
taken by our Quarter Master was a very inferior article consisting of 
Jowls, Shoulders and Sides. 

Very respectfully Your Obdt Servt 

William Scurlock.

my understanding that, the ^boye Bryerly iirformed Majr West the 
Quarter Master that he could have the bacon. I am quite confident 
had any opposition interfered, this bacon would not have been taken. 
I draw this inference from ipstructions given to me when I com- 
menced preparing to fit out the 2d Battalion of the 1st Regiment. 
I can further say that this was an inferior lot of bacon, and much 
injured by bugs worms etc. having been on hand through the sum- 
mer until November before taken.

Db Sib, J have examined the communications from Captains 
Scurlock and Williams herewith enclosed and am certain that the 
statements made therein are strictly true. I lived in the adjoining 
county at the time of taking the bacon alluded to in said communi- 
cations, and I know very well that the price of the best bacon in 
small lots in the county of Red River, at and before the time of tak- 
ing said bacon was from 15 to 17 cents per pound, and no lot was 
during that time sold for a higher price, during the summer or fall 
in which said bacon was taken.

Sib, Many official engagements have caused me to defer replying to 
your note of 10th inst^ which was received some days ago. 

I cannot but regret that the phraseology of the note which I had 
the honor to address to you on the 7th instant, should give occasion 
for any explanatory discussion, and I regret it the more because 
you seem to have misconstrued its meaning in several particulars. 
I was perfectly sensible that Messrs Campbell ^nd Dean had 
exercised sufficient adroitness to present their demand in two 
distinct forms: but it was also apparent that the aggregate sum 
demanded for five thousand (5000, pounds of bacon exceeded ten 
thousand (10.000-) dollars, which is something more than two (2) 
dollars per pound for the Bacon. The three letters from highly 
respectable gentlemen, copies of which were transmitted to you

with my last note, afford ample testimony of the facts, that the bacon 
pressed was of inferior quaUty and damaged: that the current price 
of good bacon in the neighborhood and at the time of the pressing 
was from 15 to 17 cents per pound: and one of them very distinctly 
intimates that the bacon in question was taken with the free consent 
of the person in charge of it, although the receipt given by the 
Texian Officer purports that it was pressed. I therefore cannot per- 
ceive any impropriety in considering the demand as one, and the 
price of the bacon actually taken, as fairly estimated by its relative 
proportion to the amount demanded. The partition of the claim into 
two separate items, does not vary the result to this Government. 
We acknowledge to have received 5000 lbs of bacon and no more is 
alledged to have been taken. If 10072f j^ dollars are demanded 
for it we are evidently required to pay something more than two dol- 
lars per pound. The allegation of Messrs Campbell and Dean that 
20193 pounds of inferior and damaged bacon was totally lost incon- 
sequence of 5000 lbs consisting of ''sides shoulders and bones", hav- 
ing been taken from it, is too preposterous for serious consideration: 
and I am persuaded that when the facts are fully presented to your 
mind, that you will perceive and assent to its absurdity. But it is 
perfectly cons6nant to the further fact that they have charged for 
this lost bacon, which remained in their own possession, something 
more than twice the current value of the article. 

I am constrained to express my surprise that you could for one 
moment imagine I intended to cast any ''imputation" upon the 
Government of the United States. It is true, that Grovemment, has 
"presented" this extraordinary claim and in doing so, it has dis- 
charged a common duty to its citizens. But I should beUeve with 
extreme regret, that in this instance, presentation and justification 
were convertible or synonimous terms. I have not so understood 
it, and cannot therefore be justily supposed to have designed any 
imputation upon that government which commands the highest 
filial veneration of nearly all Texians. 

That the demand of Mess. Campbell and Dean is utterly unrea- 
sonable, will I am convinced be made apparent to you when all the 
relative facts are disclosed, and then I am persuaded you will not 
differ with me in the moral estimation of that demand. Enough is 
already apparent to satisfy me on that point, and to corroborate an 
opinion founded on observation that some men of ordinary good 
repute, have small restraints of conscience in making up demands 
against a government, which is in this respect, but an aggr^ation of 
individual interests and is capable of being defrauded. 

So soon as the further information which I am expecting on this 
subject, shall be received, it will gratify me to submit it to you.

I hasten to acknowledge your note of this morning,^ and to 
express my entire concurrence, that a further discussion of the Sub- 
ject Matter, ''is, at present unnecessary and inopportune". 

In my opinion enough has been disclosed to Justify all that I have 
pronounced upon the merits of the demand of Mess Campbell and 
Dean — but I admit also, that more evidence may be necessary to a 
correct adjustment of the Specific amount to which they are equitably 
entitled. That something is due them is without controversy, but 
that their demand is exorbitant and unreasonable, is perfectly clear 
to my perception, and in pronouncing it so I have no desire to dimin- 
ish their claim a fraction of a cent below its true merits what those 
merits are is the essential matter for discussion, and where '^ the more 
minute testimony which is expected, shall be received it will afford 
me pleasing to renew the subject, and I trust to reduce it to a final

The President regret§ exceedingly the unfortunate circumstances 
in which Capt Shepard is involved and will cheerfully extend to him 
every facility in his power, to obtain a redress of his alleged griev- 
ances. Our District Judges are invested with exclusive original 
jurisdiction in Maratime cases, and it so happens at this juncture that 
the judge of the District comprizing the port of Matagorda is on his 
way to the Capitol to attend the Supreme Court of the Republic, of 
which he is a member. 

To order a special court at Matagorda at this moment might seri- 
ously conflict with the proximate session of the Supreme Court, and 
result in great public inconvenience. But^ soon after the adjourn- 
ment of the Supreme court as may be practicable, a Special Court

were pursued by himself and eleven other citizens of the Coimty of 
Fannin, a distance of about two hundred and fifty miles, and so closely 
that said Indians were compelled to leave on the way one of the 
mares belonging to the Davis's which was retaken on their trail, and 
when said Indians had been trailed up within a very short distance of 
Fort Smith in the United States where the said Indians then lived, 
your petitioners took from said Indians one of the mares belonging 
to George Dawson and the colt of said mare, but said Indians were 
able to conceal the ballance of the property stolen as aforesaid. Your 
said petitioners then went to Genl. Armstrong the Cherokee Agent 
State, and near Fort Smith to whom they made complaint and said 
Agent really pronounced that the Value of all said property together 
with the expence of pursuing it should be retained out of the first

The President has learned with profound regret, that the Ambas-

has sustained a high indignity, and a serious interruption on his home- 
ward passage through the territory of the United States.^

his landing from Europe, at the suit of Mr Timothy T. Kissam and

also at the suit of Messrs. Holbrook & Co Merchants of that city. 
And it is alleged those persons, were fully apprized of the ambassa- 
dorial character of the gentlemen against whose person their offensive 
proceedings were directed. General Henderson in a letter to this 
Department shortly after the Unfortunate transaction occurred, 
remarks, ''The first intimation, I had of their claims against me 
was from the Sheriffs who came to my apartments and arrested me 
with as little ceremony as he would have arrested a common Felon, 
although I exhibited to him my commission as Minister of Texas to 
France and England, and protested against the arrest as an insult 
to Texas and a Violation of her ambassadorial rights. " 

The most ancient and the most barbarous nations have recognized 
the rights of ambassadors as sacred and inviolable. Those rights 
include as a special privilege, exemption of the person of the ambassa- 
dor from the civil jurisdiction of the country in which he may reside 
and to whose Sovereign he is accredited. When that country is 
remote from his own and it becomes necessary to pass through 
other dominions in order to reach it or to return from it, his ambas- 
sadorial immunities accompany his progress, and all Sovereigns 
through whose dominions he may pass, are bound by the usual cotiiity 
of nations to respect his representative character and to afford him 
a free passage without molestation or hindrance unless his transition 
be attended by circumstances which involve some public hazard or 
inconvenience to the coimtry through which he passes. 

Nothing of this kind can be alledged in the passage of General Hen- 
derson from the courts of France and Great Britain, through the 
. territory of the United States, to Texas. He entertained no poUtical 
schemes adverse to the interests or the tranquility of the Government 
of the United States, nor Meditated any injury to any of its citizens. 
His object was simply to return by the most convenient route to his 
own country. In essaying to accomplish this object, after having 
rendered eminent services to his country, he has been rudely arrested 
and subjected to great inconvenience and indignity within a govern- 
ment with which Texas is proud to acknowledge her relations of 
amity and to profess her alacrity to reciprocate every feeling and 
every act of national Courtesy and friendship. 

The government of Texas is not insensible of the Vast disparity 
of physical power between itself and that of the United States. 
But this is a question of political and international right, and is not 
dependent upon physical power for its solution. It concerns all 
nations, for all are interested in sustaining the necessary immuni- 
ties, which all civilized and many barbourous powers have agreed 
reciprocally to confer upon those who bear the representative char- 
acter of a nations Sovereignty. The President cannot doubt that 
the government of the United States will Vindicate those immuni-

ties in her own behalf, and will also cause them to be rigidly respected 
on the part of her citizens, towards other Co-equal Sovereignties. 

The President expects you will represent this outrage upon the 
National dignity and the rights of Texas in Suitable terms to the 
government at Washington, and that you will request at their hands 
such reparation as from the facts and circumstances, may appear 
to be just and consonant to the Usages of Nations. General Hen- 
derson was subjected to a delay of several days and his personal 
feelings were Violated by indecorous language touching his country, 
by Mr. Kissam, one of the Plaintiffs. But the chief indignity was 
offered to the Sovereignty of Texas and such indignities are forcibly 
addressed to the Sympathies of other nations. Annexed you will 
find a list of the persons concerned in these affairs,* which list you 
will transmit to the Grovemment of the United States for their more 
certain action. It cannot be doubted that that government which 
has ever approved itself wisely jealous of its own rights, will feel the 
necessity of instituting prosecutions against its citizens who who have 
been so foi^etful of their obligations as to Violate the most saJutory 
rules of inter-national decorum and of Universal polity, which rules 
contribute so -much to the Conservation of National harmony, by 
affording a free passage to the Messengers of peace and reconciliation. 
With great consideration 

I have the honor to remain etc.

the amount, and have it paid over to him, you are authorized, and 
requested so to do. I wish you to write to him on the subject, I am 
apprehensive he may have suffered some inconvenience, for want of 
funds.* We have had within the last few days considerable excite- 
ment here, occasioned, by a very daring descent made by abou^ four 
hundred Comanche, Warriors, on Lynns landing a place much used 
as a deposit, for goods, designed for this place, and the Towns South 
west of this. They succeeded in passing down the Prarie, from the 
mountains, between the Colorado, and the Guadaloupe, and plun- 
dered the two Store Houses at the landing of some twenty or thirty 
thousand dollars worth of merchandize, and killed some of our Citi- 
zens there, as well as some in the vicinity of Victoria. The militia 
turned out with great promptitude from, the^ adjacent Settlements, 
and a party of about two hundred from this County, Bastrop and 
Gonzales, under Genl. Felix Huston and Colonel Burleson had the 
good fortune, to intercept them, about thirty five miles from this 
place and recovered all the spoil, and chastised them very severely, 
entirely dispersing them. This destruction at Lynnville, will prob- 
ably be magnified much in the newspapers. But although it was a 
bold enterprize, on the part of the Indians, when the circumstances 
are correctly known, its importance diminishes very much, Lynnville 
or Lynns landing, as it is usually called, is at the head of the Labacca 
Bay, where there were two Store Houses, and some half dozen families, 
giving a population of about thirty persons, a considerable quantity 
of merchandize were generally deposited there, until it could be 
Transported in waggons to the different points of distribution, and some 
suppUes for the Government had in the course of the Spring been 
received there though none were there at the time of the attack* The 
Indians no doubt informed by the Arkansas traders, of the fact of the 
probabihty of making rich Spoil, and encountering, but sUght resist- 
ance, from the few persons residing there, and the f aciUty afforded 
by the Prarie's for a retreat. The severe lesson they have received, 
it is believed, will prevent a similar enterprize. It is though that 
they killed but few persons, as most were able to make good their 
retreat, to the Boats on the shore. We have recovered from the 
Indians the Book of the Custom House which they were conveying 
to the mountains. It is rumored and believed that there has been 
a Revolution in the city of Mexico in favor of the constitution of 
twenty four, that Urrea is at the head of affairs. I do not put implicit

completing it made he thinks it advisable that you should inform the 
U. S. Govt., if in case he should not be present at the appointed 
time, of the cause of his detention; but will so soon as he is provided 
with means proceed immediately to the point of destination, which 
will be at farthest the Ist Deer. But if the Com and Engineer of the 
U. S. Think proper to meet at the time fixed on, to make observa- 
tions and satisfy themselves as to the point for starting, they can do 
so, as our Engineer and Surveyor are remaining there. The Presi- 
dent instructs me to inform you of these facts, that you may, if in 
your judgment you deem it proper, lay them before the U. S. Govt, 
in order that there may be no disappointment on the part of their 
Commsr. by being delayed at that point, and that he may be 
instructed not to be there until 1st Deer, instead of Ist Novr. It is 
very much regretted that so much delay has occurred in running this 
line. Much Solicitude is felt on the part of this Govt, to have it com- 
pleted. The President has been very ill since his return from Galves- 
ton. He is now convalescent but weak. Judge Lipscomb is absent, 
and will be foiu: or five weeks.

President of the United States, that the Government of the Republic 
of Texas, in the absence of all Treaty Stipulations to that effect, feels 
an anxious desire, to extend every friendly courtesy consistent with 
rules of entire reciprocity and the Comity of Nations: but in such a

Washington in relation to the unsettled question as to the Construe- . 
tion of tlfe Treaty between the Government of the United States and 
Mexico: and the obligation of the United States under that Treaty 
to restrain the Northern Indians residing on our borders. 

The President instructs me to inform you that in all probability 
it will be the most advisable to defer for the present any further dis- 
cussion of that subject: That you avail yourself of the most favorable 
opportunity to suggest, to the Secretary of State of the United States 
the importance, and mutual advantages to be derived to the respective 
Governments by establishing more definitely our relations and inter- 
course by farther Treaty stipulations. Independent of the high 
commercial advantages consequent upon reciprocal Treaty obliga- 
tions, the civil and criminal administration of the laws of the respec- 
tive Governments would be very much facilitated by properly tem- 
pered regulations relative to fugitives from justice, and public 
defaulters. It is the Presidents wish in presenting this Subject 
to the Secretary of State of the United States: that you will respect- 
fully, and zealously urge upon the Government of the United States 
the propriety of clothing the resident Minister of that Government 
here with power to Negotiate a Treaty with this Government. The 
facts, topography of the country, and all that appertains to our mutual 
relations with Northern tribes of Indians it is believed, can be perhaps 
more authentically obtained here, than at Washington City: More- 
over it would be an act of Courtesy at this juncture of our affaires, 
the tendency of which would inspire renewed confidence in the sta- 
bility of our relations foreign and domestic. Should the Government 
of the United States 3deld to this proposition, it is desirable that 
the Negotiation should be opened as early in the spring as possible. 
Your dispatch conveying the intelligence that you had represented 
to the Government of the United States the facts and circumstances 
connected with the outrage committed on the person of Gen Hender- 
son by his arrest at New York in the latter part of 1839 has been 
received, and the President instructs me to direct you to continue 
to represent in the most respectful, but decisive manner the subject 
to the Government of the United States, in conformity to your former 
instructions 

Herewith you will receive a copy of a communication froin Col 
William N Porter one of the Representatives from the County of 
Red River <* giving the evidence of the violation of the Jurisdiction 
of this Government, an outrage upon the laws and institutions of 
the same in wholly disregarding the rights and privileges of her citi- 
zens compromitting the friendly relations between the citizens of 
the Two Government residing near the line. This outrage it is 
understood was committed by a man named Ferguson a pubhc officer

of the United States. The President feels assured that the Govern-

such outrages, and punish the offending officer in the maimer pointed 
out by her pohcy and laws. We are in daily expectation of intelli-

Sir 

Your Note of the 26th of January * the last dispatch received from 
the legation, was received about the first Inst, when the return of 
Gen. Lamar to the Seat of Government and resuming the functions 
of Chief Magistrate induced me to defer addressing you any further 
instructions. His views were known upon the subject of opening a 
negotiation with the Government of the United State: for forming a 
definite treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation; and embracing 
such other objects as may mutually interest both Nations. It is the 
wish of the President that you should, without delay represent in the 
most respectful and urgent maimer to the Government of the United 
States the importance of an early Negotiation relative to the several 
objects contained in my former note, in which the several matters now 
under consideration and discussion between the two Governments 
may be embraced, and definitively adjusted upon principles of entire 
reciprocity. It is moreover the Presidents earnest desire, that 
should the Government of the United States; accede to the proposi- 
tion to open a Negotiation at this time; that it should take place at 
this Capital, as early in the summer as practicable; and that the 
Minister resident here may be charged with the same, should he not 
be superseded by another appointment. 

You will therefore direct your attention sedulously to this object 
and independent of any suggestions that have been made, use such 
other and further reasons, as your judgment may dictate the most likely 
to secure this end. It is important to the United States as well as to 
Texas that our relations should be more accurately determined; at 
least so far as our commercial intercourse and Indian relations are 
concerned. In the first respect by properly regulated treaty stipu-

lations, many of those apparently unimportant causes, but of frequent 
source of contention and which sometimes ripen into motives for dis- 
turbing the harmony of the tv^ Governments, could be wholly 
removed; and all local or political jealousies, and animosities engen- 
dered, or arising on our respective frontiers obviated or allayed: To 
vdt, the right of ingress and egress with the Slaves or body Servants 
of the citizens of either Government should be established. And 
by such regulations any conflict of jurisdiction, or violation of the 
due exercise of it upon the final establishment of the boundary line 
could be provided against, and means of punishment provided if 
infringed. The obligations of the respective Governments relative to 
the Northern Indians would be more specifically settled, in the event 
of a disposition being manifested by any of their tribes to disturb 
the peace and harmony of either of the two Governments. 
I Our respective frontiers might be prevented from becoming the 
seat of an extensive system of smuggling aUke injurious to the morals 
of the citizens and the true interests of both Governments. 

These hints are thrown out, that you may fortify yourself with some 
arguments that might not otherwise occur to your mind; and doubt- 
less you will be able to urge other and more cogent ones than here 
indicated; for relying upon your zeal and the hvely interest you 
have ever manifested for your country, it is confidently expected that 
you will not fail to impress upon the Government of the United States 
the necessity of an early negotiation on this subject. 

For whatever motives of policy or reasons may have existed here- 
tofore to suffer our relations to rest upon the doubtful and contested 
interpretation of the treaty with Mexico and the treaty of recognition; 
our position has materially changed; being, as we are, on the eve of 
carrying into execution our treaties of Amity, commerce etc. with 
England and Holland, which may be found to change in some points 
our former relations with the United States. Judge Webb will leave 
in a few days for Mexico. If you can procure the correspondence 
between Mr Adams and Don De Onis relative to the boundary in 
1818-19. It is desirable you should send it to him at Vera Cruz. 

I avail myself of this occasion to renew to you assurances of my 
high consideration and esteem. Respectfully your Obedient Servant.

Legation op the U. S. op N. A. 

TO THE Republic op Texas 

CUy of Austin March 25th 1841 
Sm— 

The undersigned Chargfi d'affaires of the United States of North 
America to the Repubhc of Texas, conceives it an imperious duty he 
owes the Government of his coimtry, superadded to the respect he 
must ever entertain for the sacredness and inviolability of the law of 
Nations, to apprise his Excellency the President of the Republic, 
through the Honorable Secretary of State, of an outrage, which the 
imdersigned believes to be flagrant in its nature and premeditated in 
its character. 

On the afternoon of yesterday, the Hon Alphonso De Saligny 
Chargfi d'affaires of the King of France, whilst in the act of visiting 
my family, at my lodgings, and when within the enclosure of the 
yard, was rudely and violently assaulted by Mr Richard Bullock of 
this City. 

I need not say to His Excellency the President, or the Honorable 
Secretary of State, that the indignity thus offered — voluntarily and 
premeditatedly — is as sensibly felt by the imdersigned as it must be 
by the Honorable Chargfi himself. 

The imdersigned from the well known and acknowledged character 
of his Excellency the President, for uprightness, intelligence and 
integrity — and from his laudable desire to harmoniously cultivate 
the relations that must exist between Nations allied by Treaty 
stipulations, and in the absence of which all intercourse must cease — 
doubts not, for a moment, he will promptly direct strict ^ measures 
to be taken for the redress of the grievances complained of, as are 
due to the parties and in consonance with the universally acknowl- 
edged Law of Nations. 

It is due to Mr Bullock to say, he called on the undersigned this 
morning, and disclaimed, in the most earnest manner, any intention 
on his part, to offer an indignity to the undersigned or his family. 
He certainly knew the Honorable Chargfi of France, visited no one in 
his house-hold but the undersigned and his family, and those visits 
daily in their character.

Sm: 

The imdersigned has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 
Note of the 25th Inst complaining of an "outrage flagrant in its 
nature and premeditated in its character" as it is alledged, inflicted 
in the afternoon of the 24th Inst on the "Hon A De. Saligny Charg6 
d'affaires of The King of France, whilst in the act of visiting your 
family'' at your lodgings and when within the enclosure of the yard, 
who was rudely and violently assaulted by Mr Richard Bullock of 
this City. 

From the statements contained in your note; as also from the 
relation of the affair complained of, as given by Mr. Saligny, in the 
note which I had the honor to receive from him of the same date the 
indignity as alledged appears to have been solely directed against the 
Hon. Mr Saligny without reference to Mr Flood or his family 

The President however much he may regret the occurrence of that 
evening, and the acts complained of which for a time might seem to 
threaten a disturbance of that cordial and harmonious feeling which 
he hopes will ever characterise the relations of those Governments, 
which have given such unequivocal proofs of their friendship and 
sympathy for the Government of Texas as the United States and 
France; cannot conceive nevertheless how the subject can form the 
just ground of complaint upon the part of Mr. Flood. For it appears 
that Mr. Bullock '* disclaimed in the most earnest maimer, any inten- 
tion on his part to offer an indignity to the Hon Chargfi d'affaires of 
the United States or his family." 

The undersigned regrets that an occasion should have arisen, which 
could for a moment [have] induced Mr. Flood, to feel himself identi- 
fied or embraced in a question involving alledged outrages upon the 
person and household of Mr Saligny Chargfi d'affaires of France;

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 
29th instant in answer to mine of the 25th. 

I am wholly at a loss to understand by what process of reasoning 
or even construction of language you arrive at the conclusion that I 
feel myself ''embraced in a question involving alleged outrages upon 
the household of Mr Saligny Chai^6 d'aflFaires of France'' — ^for on no 
occasion have I expressed an opinion in relation to any difficulty 
between citizens of the Repubhc and the ''household" of the Hon- 
orable Chargfi of His Majesty, the King of France. I must there- 
fore, most respectfully decline the position [in which] your note 
assumes to place me, in relation to this matter. 

In my communication to you of the 25th, I complained of but a 
single circumstance — the unwarrantable attack of Mr Bullock upon 
the person of my distinguished guest, while in the act of visiting my 
family at their lodgings. The indignity, I thought, reflected quite 
as much upon me as it possibly could upon Mr Saligny, and in this 
opinion I hesitate not in believing the Government of my country 
will sustain me 

I extremely regret His Excellency, the President, "cannot con- 
ceive how the subject can form the just ground of complaint upon the 
part of Mr Flood'' for shortly after the transaction occured he both 
entertained and expressed a different opinion.

Matfield to Bee.* 

Department of State 
City of Austin 20th April I84I. 
Sm 

The undersigned Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas has 
the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of the 7th of 
March last,* which together with yours of the 25Ui*^ of January have 
been submitted to the President for his determination thereon. For 
the reasons suggested by you, it was deemed advisable to defer the 
further discussion of the subject of our Indian relations, and the mat- 
ters connected with that question until the new administration of the 
United States came into office. That event having occurred the 
President wishes you immediately to call the attention of the Gov- 
ernment of the United States again to that subject. By reference 
to the discussions that have at yarious periods been held relative to 
the Treaty of 1831 with Mexico,** it will be seen that the United States 
Government, has uniformly when her interest was involved assumed 
the position, that that Treaty in all its parts was binding and obliga- 
tory upon the Republic of Texas. Without questioning the rules of 
international law, which could admit of such an interpretation of the 
Treaty, this Government acquiesced in the position assumed; and 
in 1838 by a proclamation of the President the provisions of the 5th 
and 6th Articles of that treaty were declared in force and have been 
observed by the authorities of this country to the great detriment of 
our revenue. 

Under the Construction given by Mr. Forsyth to the 33rd article 
of that Treaty Texas would not be receiving an equivalent, for the 
sacrifices she suffers in her revenues; by allowing Vessels belonging 
to the United States to enter our Ports free of Tonnage duty. To 
arrive at a fair interpretation of that instrument the whole should be 
construed by its several parts and articles, by which means its true 
spirit and intention may be more accurately defined. It will be 
found that concessions, and privileges are contained in many of its 
clauses and provisions in many of its articles of which there cannot 
be found a sufficient guarantee or equivalent secured in the same 
article. This naturally arose from the relative strength, commerce, 
and political condition of the contracting parties at the time of mak- 
ing the Treaty, as will be seen by reference to the articles cited. 

The United States at the time had an extended commerce, and 
heavy Shipping. Mexico on the contrary (and with but remote pros- 
pects of improvement) was limited in her commerce, and yet more in

her shipping. The mutual guarantee then as to tonnage and other 
charges enumerated in the "5th and 6th*' articles of the Treaty can- 
not be said to secure to Mexico an equivalent, as it was apparent and 
must for years Continue that the whole trade of Mexico with the 
United States upon the Gulf would be carried in American bottoms. 

Again the United States was established in all the Departments of 
the Govenm\ent. Union and harmony prevailed throughout the 
whole, with a large standing Army, and an Organized Militia, and 
overflowing Treasury. Mexico on the other hand, was cut up into 
political parties, distracted in her MiUtary Strength and organization. 
She evidently sought to secure to herself an equivalent in the 33rd 
Article of the Treaty for the advantages obtained for the American 
shipping interest in the 5th and 6th articles of the same. Independ- 
ent of those considerations, the United States was bound upon prin- 
ciples of Justice aside from any treaty stipulations upon the subject, 
to guard the Government of Mexico, her citizens, or territory from 
hostiUties or incursions from those various tribes of Indians, which 
by her policy she was establishing on the immediate borders of the 
latter. Taking this view of the subject, which it is believed is the 
just one, supported by the relative miUtary and political position of 
the contracting parties, as well the natural and poUtical obligations' 
reciprocally resting upon both parties, it is difficult to conceive how 
the words of that instrument can admit of the construction given by 
Mr Forsyth, or in what respect the Executive of the United States 
is wanting "the legal power to check or restrain by force the volun- 
tary and peaceable M^ations of Indians" etc. 

The 33rd article imposes several distinct obligations, and em- 
braces as many distinct stipulations It is first agreed '' that the two 
contracting parties, shall by all the means in their power maintain 
peace and harmony among the several Indian Nations who inhabit 
the land adjacent to the lines and rivers which form the boundaries 
of the two countries.'^ This first stipulation, of itself impUes too 
plainly to be misunderstood, the exercise of MiUtary force, should it 
become necessary to answer the objects contemplated, ''peace and 
harmony among the several Indian Nations who inhabit etc" by all 
the means in their power which become imnecessary words unless 
force for the accomplishment of the end^ sought could be resorted to. 

The next clause of the Article however it is beUeved leaves no room

express and palpable stipulation of the most sacred and binding char- 
acter, as between nations, to reciprocally, not only to restrain by force 
all hostilities, but incursions '* Voluntary and peaceable" or of what- 
ever kind, of the Indians Uving within the respective boundaries of the 
two Nations. If such a restraint is not held over the Indians belong- 
ing to the United States, it may be asked, in what manner can that 
Government fulfil the obligation imposed by that Treaty if binding 
between the Government of the United States and the RepubUc of 
Texas, when in the same article under discussion they bind them- 
selves not to suffer their Indians to attack the Citizens of the United 
Mexican States nor the Indians inhabiting their territory" unless by 
a resort to force to confine them within the limits designated by the 
former Government or their future abode under the policy adopted 
by that Government in the removal of the Several tribes west of the 
Mississippi? Otherwise the territory of Texas might easily become 
the hunting grounds of the numerous hordes of Northern Indians 
established on our immediate borders through the poUcy of that Gt)v- 
emment, and our citizens an easy prey to the tomahawk and scalping 
knife of the restless savage, and their property a luring bait to the 
enactment of scenes appalling to humanity and the United States a 
witness to the scene, and not an arm extended to stay it; because the 
Migration of the Indians to our territory was under the guise of a vol- 
untary and peaceable removal, and their "nomadic habits interposed 
obstacles to the restraining of them within their own territory and 
the limits designated them. From the well known character of the 
various Indian Nations, it has long since been amply demonstrated 
to the American people that persuasions and treaties have had but 
little influence in curbing (with some exceptions) the wild and savage 
habits of those tribes; and that a ready, or absolute demonstration of 
force, has alone been adequate to restrain them from predatory war- 
fare, and predatory incursions upon their neighbors. All of which 
considered, it is not conceived that the treaty by any construction of 
language or rules for the interpretation of treaties is admissible of the 
construction intimated by the Government of the United States. 

The undersigned has been thus full, without resorting to all the 
arguments that might be adduced which must readily suggest them- 
selves to your mind, as the President is soUcitous that the discussion 
of this question should be definitely determined, and the extent to 
which the United States will go clearly ascertained. It will be recol- 
lected that she has on a former occasion in 1836, claimed I beUeve 
the right of occupying the territory of Texas with an armed force, in 
order fully to enable her to fulfil the obligations (as it was alledged) 
imposed upon her by the article in question. ^ 

The President however with a view to guard against all future 
contingencies as well as to secure to the Government of Texas a just

reciprocity and correspondence in her political and commercial rela- 
tions, deems it advisable that the necessary preparatory measures 
should be adopted to put a termination if binding at all to the stipula- 
tions of the treaty so far as relates to commerce and Navigation. This 
line of policy becomes the more imperative since the Government of the 
United States evades as it is beUeved the plain and obvious obliga- 
tions pointed out in the 33rd article of the Treaty. In the opening 
of Spring we may again expect predatory bands of Indians from the 
United States, to prevent which this Government is not advised that 
the Government of the United States have taken any precautionary 
measures. 

Persuasions have hitherto had but Uttle influence over the Indians 
residing on our borders. Besides under the present system, our 
revenue is materially crippled, and our duties placed upon a basis 
highly detrimental to the public interest. In view of all the circum- 
stances I am directed by the President, to instruct you, to formally 
notify the Government of the United States; of the intention of this 
Government to terminate the stipulations of the Treaty so far as 
relates to ''Commerce and Navigation". This notification you will 
give in Conformity to the 34th article of the Treaty, confining your 
attention to the objects therein specified. 

The President approves of the correspondence you have opened 
with the ChevaUer d'Ai^aiz Envoy extraordinary and Minister Pleni- 
potentiary of her Catholic Majesty the Queen of Spain;* and desires 
that you will keep the Government informed of the nature, and spirit 
with which the propositions have been received, by the Government 
of Spain independent of the considerations urged in your communi- 
cations to the ChevaUer d'Ai^aiz. Texas would become an active 
Competitor in furnishing to Spain, and Cuba, many of those articles 
of import which are now monopolized by other quarters of the Globe. 

You will receive as soon as the disposition of her Catholic Majesty 
is ascertained detailed instructions to guide you in a negotiation aUke 
important to the Commerce of Texas and Spain. In the mean time 
you will endeavour to obtain the earUest information consistent with 
the relations you bear to the ChevaUer d'Argaiz. 

Herewith you will receive the petition of Doctr Robertson of this 
City relative to the capture of his Negroes. It is believed that the 
stipulations of the 33rd article of the Treaty will cover this case; as 
by the laws of Mexico Slavery was not tolerated. This subject you 
wiU caU the attention of the United States to, and urge the propriety 
of taking efficient measures for the restoration of the slaves mentioned 
It will be seen from the multipUcity of cases accruing, giving rise to 
the mutual interpretation of both Governments that the Government 
of the United States will not longer delay entering into a negotiation

Intelligence reached us to day of the melancholy event to the United 
States in the death of Gen. William Henry Harrison late President of 
that Government. In honor to his Memory, and to the Government 
over which he presided as Chief Magistrate only for the brief period 
of one Month, until death relieved him of his cares, our flag is flying 
at half mast, and salute Guns^ are firing every thirty minutes, until 
sunset. Col Bee's letter of April 6th to Judge Burnet ^ mentions 
his intentions of visiting the South until the extra session. In the 
mean time the President directs that you will seduously urge upon 
the Government of the United States the necessity of immediately 
opening the negotiation for a treaty. This Department is not yet 
notified that the attention of the Government of the United States 
has been called to the Subject. If it is concluded on the part of that 
Government to open the negotiation at Washington it is important 
that this Department should be speedily informed thereof, in order 
that the necessary instructions should be forwarded to the Legation 
at Washington City. 

The reasons that have hitherto been furnished you, together with 
the reasons connected with the difficulties attending a due under- 
standing of the stipulations of the treaty, will it is hoped, together 

a See Hamilton's letter of that date in the Correspondence with France.

with such arguments as may naturally be suggested to your mind, 
enable you to induce the Government of the United States to enter at 
once upon the negotiation, whereby it is believed our relations can be 
more satisfactorily determined, and upon principles of entire reci- 
procity. 

In your intercourse with the Secretary of State, you may find it 
more advantageous, and better calculated to facilitate a determina- 
tion of the question to seek as often as possible a personal interview, 
and discuss the question verbally with Mr Webster, taking care always 
to reduce to writing the substance of the conversation held at such 
interviews. 

The difficulty of answering or replying to any objections that may 
be taken, and of discussing the details of any given question by 
written communications, renders the discussion prolix and tedious; 
and in this matter it is becoming a question of no inconsiderable 
importance not only to the agricultural and commercial interest of 
this coimtry, but particularly so, as far as relates to our revenue, and 
the Indians on our borders. 

These remarks are thrown out as hints; as the manner of conducting 
the discussion of this questiou must be determined by you. It is 
desirable that you should not fail to communicate the earliest infor- 
mation of the conclusion of the Government of the United States on 
this Subject.

Soon after assuming the duties of Acting Secretary of State several 
communications from Mr Amory of the 12th, 14th, 19th, 23rd and

copy of his reply, having accidently left it at Galveston. Presuming 
that Mr Mayfield's reply to your several Communications was full 
upon every point, on which you wished for information or instruc- 
tions, I do not consider it necessary to do more than acknowledge 
their receipt. 

More recently Mr Amory's communication of the 20th May," has 
been received The formal announcement to the Government of the 
United States contained in that letter, of the resolutions of this 
Government to terminate the Treaty of the 5th April 1831, between 
the United States and Mexico, so far as it is binding upon the United 
States and Texas, in all matters relating to Commerce and Naviga- 
tion, as soon after the date of said communication as is compatible 
with the provisions of the 34th article of said Treaty, renders it 
highly important that a substitute should be provided at as early a 
day as possible. It seems quite evident from what has fallen from 
Mr Webster in the personal interviews you and Mr Amory have had 
with him, that he will not consent that the treaty should be made 
here. It will therefore be of vast importance to us to know dis- 
tinctly, as far as you can ascertain by conversations with Mr Webster, 
or otherwise, which, or how many of the principal features we wish 
to incorporate in the Treaty, they will make most difficulty in grant- 
ing and what will probably go without question. There seems to be 
three distinct and separate heads or branches, under the one or the 
other of which, every topic that will probably enter into the con- 
templated treaty will be naturally considered. Viz: 1st. The free 
Navigation of the border rivers, The Sabine and Red Rivers to the 
Sea, 2nd Our Indian Relations, 3rd Our Commercial and Maratime 
relations on the high Seas. 

This Department is not informed, whether the Grovemment of the 
United States will contest the first point or not, but as it is one of 
great and growing imj>ortance to a very large and wealthy portion 
of our citizens, it should no longer be permitted to remain in doubt. 
In a similar case in the early history of the United States, the position 
which that Government took is well known, one of the very first 
questions which was raised after the close of their Revolutionary war 
with Spain, was upon the subject of the Navigation of the Mississippi. 
The position then assumed by all the Diplomatic Agents of the 
United States, who had occasion to touch upon this subject, was 
their "natural right to the free Navigation of the Mississippi to its 
entrance in to the sea." ^ The Congress too on several occasions, 
asserted their claim in strong and emphatic language. One resolu- 
tion particularly may be mentioned. On the 16th Septr 1788 the 
United States in Congress assembled, Resolved "That The free 
Navigation of the Mississippi is a clear and essential right of the

United States, and that the same ought to be considered and sup- 
ported as such". And in the resolution which followed, a stop was 
actually put to the negotiations with Spain and the whole matter 
referred to Congress, because of the unwavering pertinacity, with 
which Spain Clung to her claim of the exclusive right to the use of 
that river. 

The conduct pursued by the United States throughout that con- 
troversy, is a matter of history to be found in all their public records. 
And as their clainv there was founded in reason and supported by 
strong and unanswerable arguments, it is presumed its reasonableness, 
will not now be denied. 

The position which the United States then occupied towards Spain, 
we now occupy towards her precisely, as far as the Navigation of the 
Red river is concerned. As regards the free Navigation of the Sabine, 
the question is a little varied; but not it is thought materially. The 
United States own to the Western bank below the 31°^ N latitude, 
above that the River is entirely our own, so that our claim is stronger 
in this case than in the former. In fact the bare supposition that our 
right to the free navigation of the Sabine will be questioned, seems a 
violent one, and the only object to be attained in introducing it into 
the Treaty is to shut up the door against all future doubt. I have 
not been able to ascertain whether the right of this country to the 
free navigation of the red River has ever yet been formally called in 
question by the Grovemment of the United States; but murmurs and 
complaints from among our own citizens begin to be frequent of 
seizures and detentions of Texan produce by the authorities of the 
United States above and below Natchitoches. Our settlements on 
the upper part of the Red River renders it necessary that this matter 
should be definitely settled, at the very earliest possible date. The 
right to the free navigation of this River ought never to be abandoned. 
The Mode only of exercising it should be specified in the Treaty. 

In regard to our Indian relations, it would be diflBcult it seems to 
me> to place them upon a fairer or more equitable footing than the 
one they already occupy in the 33rd article of the Treaty between 
the United States and Mexico, which Treaty both Texas and the 
United States have tacitly acknowledged to be mutually binding. A 
little more precision might perhaps be given to certain expressions in 
it, if there be any reasonable doubt as to their true meaning, a doubt 
which however, I have never entertained myself. In this I perceive 
I differ with Mr Mayfield who thinks that the word "incursions" as 
used in the Treaty means ''peaceable" as well as "warlike" incurs 
sions — ^an interpretation which I think is Contradicted by the Con- 
text. I do not conceive howef er that it matters much which is the 
true interpretation. The Treaty will expire in May next at any rate,

and before that time it is hoped a new one will be formed. The 
mutual obligations of the two Governments to restrain their Indians 
from making war or committing depredations upon the citizens and 
property of their neighbors, is to my mind a natural one. It follows 
of course from their claims of sovereignty. The Indians residing 
within the limits of the United States, and under their avowed juris- 
diction, are, so far as all foreign powers are concerned, *' Citizens" of 
that Country, and no nation will be permitted to enquire into, or 
intermeddle with, the manner in which they are governed, and that 
every government is bound to restrain their Citizens from making 
war on a friendly power, needs only to be asserted to be universally 
accorded. The Same reasoning is o^ course equally applicable to 
this Government. If this principal be acquiesced in by the United 
States, there can be no serious difficulty in the way in pointing out 
in what maimer restraints shall be exercised. When Indians are at 
peace with the power, within whose limits they reside, and make 
war upon the other contracting power, it ought to be the bounden 
duty of the former, to send such a Military fore© against such Indians, 
as wiU be sufficient to disarm them, and to capture the principal 
offenders, who should be given up for punishment to the aggrieved 
party. And if such Indians are pensionaries of the power within 
whose limits they reside, their pensions ought for a limited period 
to be cut off, and remuneration made for the damages doniB by said 
Indians. But if any tribe or tribes of Indians are first at war with 
the power within whose limits they reside, and afterwards make war 
or hostile incursions upon the territory of the other contracting party, 
all that either party could in justice require of the other, would be 
the sending of such a Military force against them as the protection 
of their own territory and Citizens would demand, without being held 
responsible for any property taken off or destroyed by the Indians. 
One other point only presents itself on this subject Viz: the obliga- 
tion on the part of the United States to remove such of their Indians 
from our territory as have emigrated from theirs. 

We may well insist that this duty on their part is clear and un- 
questionable so far as relates to all such Indians as have come into 
our territory since our separation from Mexico, as well as to those 
who came here prior to that period without the sanction or permis- 
sion of the Supreme power of Mexico and this upon such obvious 
principles that it is not thought necessary [to] enumerate them. But 
that there is another obligation on the part of the United States to 
remove such as came here by permission of the Mexican Authorities, 
anterior to the date of our declaration of Independence, and while 
we were yet of course an integral part of the Mexican Confederacy, 
may well be doubted; and by the last administration of the United 
States I recollect, was expressly denied. How far the present

administration will be willing to go, will be for you to ascertain, 
which may best be done, at personal interviews with the Secretary 
of State. 

There seems no necessity of specifying by name, what tribes of 
Indians are meant to be included in the Treaty. The principle once 
settled, will embrace aU residing in the respective limits of the two 
Governments. 

As regards the Third principal point, little need be said about it in 
this letter, which is intended rather to direct your attention to the 
particular subjects to be considered in the contemplated Treaty, 
than to instruct you conclusively and finally on them. This could 
not be done at all, without risking an inconsistency in the instruction 
given by this Department, until a copy of Mr Mayfield's last com- 
munication to you is obtained,^ and ought not to be done until this 
Department is better informed of the views intertained by the gov- 
ernment of the United States on some of the most important points. 
Entire reciprocity is all that either government ought to, and I pre- 
sume does expect. What amounts to reciprocity has been so long, 
and so well settled by numerous Commercial Treaties between differ- 
erent nations, that there are few or no principles left in doubt. 

It seems but fair that as the United States are to have all the 
benefit of treating at home, where they can have frequent reference 
to the proper Departments for information and instruction; that we 
should be entitled to something like an equivalent. It is proposed 
therefore, that the Government of the United States, after being 
fully advised of the principal points which this government desires 
to settle by the Treaty, submit a sketch of such a Treaty as they are 
willing to make to you as the representative of this government. 
The only advantage we could expect to derive from their compliance 
with this proposition, would be, that it would save much time, as the 
fewer points there are left in dispute, the less time will be required to 
settle them. We oflfer, provided they will consent to make the 
Treaty at Austin, to do what we require of them. 

It is hoped that as soon after the receipt of this letter as possible, 
you will give this Department all the information you may be able 
to obtain upon the different subjects presented, as well as the answer 
of the United States Government to the last proposition. 

In whatever this letter may conflict with Mr Mayfields last com- 
munication to you from Galveston, this must yield, and his will be 
your instructions, the reasons for this is obvious to you. 

The Santa F6 expedition took up the line of march from the en- 
campment on Brushy, distant about twenty miles, on the morning 
of the 20th Inst. The Military under Command of Brevet Brigadier 

a liayfield's last oommnnlcation on the subject seems to have been from Galveston (see the first p«n>- 
grq>h of this letter), bat it has not been found.

General Hugh McLeod, consists of five companies mounted infantry 
and one of Artillery. A caravan of Merchants with goods suited to 
the market drawn in waggons accompanies the expedition under the 
protection of the Government. The instructions given by this 
Department to the Commissioners are to the effect. That they are to 
endeavour to prevail upon the people of New Mexico resideing within 
our limits^ to submit quietly and peaceably to an incorporation with 
us, and to acknowledge our right of Jurisdiction to the fullest extent. 
This being accomplished our revenue laws are to be put in force at 
once and a small Military force kept up there for the purpose of 
repelling any sudden attack of the Mexicans or Indians." A Commis- 
sioner is also appointed to reside at Santa F6 as the representative 
or agent of this Government, with special instructions for his guide.* 
No further alterations are contemplated either in their laws or form 
of Government, than are absolutely necessary, from the alteration in 
their affairs, by a change of their allegiance. It is expected that a 
part of the expedition will return to this City as early as the 15th 
of Novr. next, and will probably bring delegates to our Congress. 

I neglected to mention above one other subject which it would be 
well to sound the United States Government upon. I mean the 
granting by each government to the Citizens of the other a free 
introduction of a limited number of slaves when taken as servants, 
for the purpose of attending on their masters or owners, and not for 
hire or sale. This is a delicate topic and will therefore require very 
nice management. You must exercise your own Judgment in ascer- 
taining what effect the introduction of such a feature into the 
Treaty, would have upon it in the Senate. It would not do to 
hazard the whole Treaty for the accomplishment of an object com- 
paratively insignificent. I only call your attention to this, as I 
have to the other topics embraced in this letter, reserving more 
particular instructions, for Mr Mayfield on his return to the Seat of 
Government.

Sir: 

Since my last letter to you, Mr Ainory's favor of the 12th ult. has 
been received to which no particular reply is necessary. We are 
anxiously expecting further advices from you upon the subject of the 
contemplated Treaty. The President is extremely anxious to have 
that business closed before the meeting of Congress if possible, and 
at any rate before the expiration of his term of office. A Treaty upon 
a basis of strict reciprocity cannot be a bad one, and with no other 
guide you might confidently proceed to the discussion of the different 
articles. The protracted absence of Mr Mayfield has prevented any 
more specific instructions than the hints contained in my Communi- 
cation of the 21st June last. 

I have reason to believe that some of the original drafts of our 
earliest public papers were taken on to Washington City, and are 
now on file in some of the Departments there, probably the war 
[Department]. The journal for several days of the proceedings of the 
Convention, The original Constitution et<5. are all missing 

These papers if there, will doubtless be given up with pleasure by 
the Government of the United States. The mode of making the 
application, can be best judged of by you. Your particular atten- 
tion is called to it as a matter of interest in the future history of this 
Country. 

I enclose a communication for Genl. Hamilton ^ wliich I wish 
forwarded by first safe opportunity. The letters and the papers 
accompanying it are left unsealed that you may first read them. 
They will fully advise you of all that has transpired up to this time. 
When I wrote last night to Gen H. I thought I should accompany 
Genl Lamar to Galveston. I think now it will not be necessary. 
Genl Lamar will go down alone, and either he or Judge Webb will 
inform Gen Hamilton of all that will be necessary for him to know.

Unfortunately our Mail arrangement is such as to leave but one

Your communication of the 31st ult, the receipt of which was

of Texas, from feelings of comity which exist between the two 
Republic's, would not be disinclined to surrender to the proper 
authorities fugitives from justice from the United States,'' and that 
you are "therefore instructed by the Government of the United 
States to request through you (me) that the Government of Texas 
surrender the said Moro Philips to the proper authorities of Louisi- 
ana." Whatever may be the "feelings" which this Government 
entertains on this Subject, the avowal of the accredited agent of the 
United States on a recent occasion, when making a similar demand 
of this Government, " that the Executive of the United States is not 
empowered to deliver Criminals to foreign Governments in the 
absence of Treaty stipulations to that effect"** would of itself be 
amply sufficient to justify the President in refusing to comply with 
your request even if his constitutional right to do so, was clear and 
unquestionable; for it surely cannot be expected of one nation, to 
exercise an act of international courtesy, when it is distinctly informed 
beforehand that the same act, under similar circumstances would not 
be reciprocated. I do not mean now to intimate, what course this 
Government would have pursued if the case had been differently 
presented. I know of no public act or declaration on the part of this 
Government, which authorizes the inference that it (the Government) 
would not be disinclined to surrender to the proper authorities, " fugi- 
tives from justice from the United States" nor indeed do I understand 
you as deducing your inference from any such authority. If I am 
mistaken in this you will correct me. But even then the President 
would feel himself clearly absolved from any obligation he might 
otherwise have felt himself under, by the official avowal of the policy 
as above quoted, which the Executive of the United States would 
pursue in like cases towards this Government. 

In no view of the case does the President then feel that he is called 
on to deliver to the United State, Moro Philips, who, it is alledged, is 
a fugitive from justice; and I am therefore instructed by the Presi- 
dent to inform you that he declines, for the reasons above given, 
complying with your request. 

It affords me much pleasure Sir, to furnish you with a copy of the 
Treaty between this Government and France, as you request. It is 
sent with this Communication. 

I avail myself of this occasion to renew to you assurances of my 
high regard and consideration.

Department of State 

Austin 7th Septr 184L 
Sir: 

Your communication of the 31st July was received by the last 
Mail, and with it, a copy of your note to Mr Webster on the sub- 
ject of the contemplated treaty with the United States.^ A short 
time previous to this, yours of the 13th July to this Department'' 
also came safely to hand. In this last you mention that you are 
entitled to a reply from Mr Webster to your note of the 19th May 
relative to Indian encroachments.** This subject is becoming a 
very interesting one to the people of this country, and it is earnestly 
hoped, that you will receive a speedy and satisfactory reply from 
the Government of the United States. Doctor Robertson whose 
negroes, you will recollect, were taken by the Indians, and were 
subsequently found to be held by persons residing within the ter- 
ritory of the United States (the evidence of which was furnished 
to you from this Department on the 20th April) has already gone to 
great expense in the pursuit of his property; and has been damaged, 
by the loss of time etc. to an amount, that even a prompt restitution 
of his property could not repay. But if it is delayed much longer, 
the chances of finding the negroes again will be very much diminished, 
and their value greatly lessened by the idle and dissolute^ habits 
which negroes so readily contract from a long residence with savages. 
It is particularly desirable therefore, that this subject should not 
be permitted to slumber, but that you should press as earnestly as 
would be becoming, for an answer. 

Mr Webster's reply to your communication of the 13th « April 
remonstrating against the violation of our territory by a deputy 
Marshall (Ferguson) of the state of Arkansas, a copy of which was 
enclosed in your despatch of the 13th July, if not altogether satis- 
factory, is at least all that we could reasonably demand under the 
pecuUar circumstances of the case. It is of the less importance in a 
National point of view, as the Uke cannot well happen again. The 
boundary line is completed, and the officers of neither Government 
can hereafter plead ignorance upon this point. 

From your communication of the 31st July, I learn with regret 
that Mr Webster will probably adhere to his first resolution as to 
the place of negotiating the Contemplated Treaty. Tlie press of 
business in his Department and the heavy demands upon his time

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 97 

will not permit him to give the subject that constant attention 
which we so much desire; and I much fear the negotiations will be 
protracted beyond the constitutional term of the present admin- 
istration. Nothing remains however, but to use all diligence in 
urging it forward in Washington with all possible despatch. 

Your note of the 27th July to Mr Webster, has been carefully read 
by the President and receives his approval. You were not mistaken 
in supposing that this Government would claim the right of entrepdt; 
or of transhipping their produce from some point on the Mississippi, 
free of all charges except the ordinary ones of Storage, wharfage etc. 
when the produce is to be sent to a foreign coimtry for sale or traffic. 
What point the Government of the United States may think proper 
to assign to us for this purpose is not very material (though an eye 
should certainly be had to^ its convenience) The principle is what 
we are most concerned about. In my communication to you of the 
21st June,** I did not it is true, mention this as one of the principal 
heads of the contemplated Treaty. I regarded it, as you have 
rightly conjectured, as included in our claim of the right of free 
navigation of the Red River to its entrance into the sea, and it is 
so essential to a full exercise of that right, that it is difficult to con- 
ceive how it could be supposed to exist without. It would in fact 
be manifestly absurd, to concede to us the right of free navigation, 
and in the very same instrument assert the right of taxing us upon 
the transhipment of our produce into vessels calculated for the sea; 
which, from the unfitness of the river craft for the navigation of the 
ocean, would always have to be done. It involves an absurdity of 
terms, for how can that navigation be said to be free, when we are 
compelled at some point to pay the duties exacted by the impost 
laws for all goods introduced into the coimtry? There can be no 
need of a Treaty to secure the right to us (I mean the right of import- 
ing into the United States all of our produce upon paying the duties 
thereupon) for we already enjoy it, in common with all Nations 
who are on friendly terms with the United States. Nor do I con-' 
ceive that it ought to make any difference whether we employ as 
our carriers, Texan or American bottoms or bottoms of a third power. 
You recognize none I perceive in your commxinication to Mr Webster, 
though in your letter to this Department, you make a distinction 
between American bottoms and our own 

If the United States have it in contemplation as you seem to 
intimate, to deny to this coimtry the right of entrepdt, they, would 
be much more likely to do so, if it was believed by them that we were 
to be our own carriers, while the prospect of opening a new channel 
to the enterprise and industry of American Ship owners could not

fail to operate as an inducement with that Government to grant our 
demands. I do not apprehend therefore that you will find any 
difficulty in negotiating for the right to tranship in American bot- 
toms, if they concede to us the right to tranship in our own. As 
concerns bottoms of third parties, it is more a subject of Treaty 
between the United States and such parties than between us. You 
will however be authorized and expected to see that nothing enters 
into the Tl-eaty on this subject, which would be injurious to the 
interests of our citizens. 

Until the receipt of your last communication I did not apprehend 
much difficulty in settling with the United States the free navigation 
of the border Rivers to the Sea. That is the last nation that ought to 
question that right, for no other has taken such strong ground in 
favor of the principle, or been more consistent in maintaining it. 
In addition to the references I have already cited you to in proof of 
this, you have but to turn to her diplomatic correspondence to find 
volumes to the same eflFect; Besides This I do not think you will find 
it difficult to establish that it is now the settled law of nations as 
recognized by most, if not aU the leading powers of Europe, Thai 
navigable Rivers are public highways, when they rise in one coimtry 
and empty into the sea, in another, so far at least, as the coimtry in 
which they rise is concerned. I well recollect reading in a Newspaper 
a case of this kind, which was settled some two or three years ago, 
in some of the European Governments, (I have forgotten which) 
nor have I as you know such books as would assist my memory; 
but this I well recollect, that the principle was said to be extended 
beyond the rule laid down at the Congress of Vienna. Should it be 
necessary you will probably be able to find the authority last 
alluded to in the libraries of some of the Legations in Washington. 

This question is one of vast importance to us, and I have therefore 
devoted a large share of my letter to it. It remains now, only to 
instruct you concerning the conclusions to which the President has 
come after a mature consideration of the subject in all its bearings. 

He directs then, that imless the United States concede to us the 
right of freely navigating the border Rivers, and of transhiping 
whatever we may have for export, free of all tariff and impost duties, 
sjid the right of landing and storing our produce when vessels are 
not in readiness to take it off, by paying the customary charges for 
wharfage, storage etc. that you be instructed to enter into no Treaty 
at all upon this subject. It is one upon which this Government 
can make no compi;omise without inflicting a lasting injury upon that 
portion of our inhabitants residing on or near the border Rivers; 
and at the same time jeopardizing a great national right, the enforce- 
ment of which, as soon as its importance is felt, and the principles 
upon which it rests are imderstood, will be demanded by every

voice of the Nation. We had best therefore, meet the question at 
once. No Government ever can, without the loss of National honor, 
stand by and see her citizens stripped of a ^' right'', which, to quote 
the language of the Congress of the United States on a case precisely 
similar, is ^^dear and essentiai'* and one that would be weak enough 
to allow it, could never be sustained by a free people. We have as 
little doubt of our right, as the United States had of theirs when 
contending with Spain, for the free navigation of the Mississippi. 

In all your intercourse therefore with Mr Webster, whenever the 
navigation of the border Rivers is the subject, you will always repre- 
sent the free navigation and the rigJU of entrepdt as a Sine qua non. 
If both of these points are not conceded, you will not be authorized 
to consent to any arrangement concerning the navigation of the Red 
River particularly (for the Sabine stands on a different footing) by 
which by the remotest implication, there is any abandonment of the 
principle we have set out with. 

If it is found to be impossible to incorporate our demands on this 
head in the Treaty; then that entire branch of the subject must be 
left open, and your attention will be turned to the points mentioned 
in my former communications, and your note to Mr Webster of the 
27th July. 

If we are balked in so essential a feature of the Treaty as the free 
navigation of the border Rivers, it will be difficult to make any 
Treaty which will be satisfactory to this nation. Under these cir- 
cumstances therefore, too long a period for its duration ought not to 
be fixed upon. The navigation question must come up again and 
that before very long; when it will be desirable to have the subject 
open for discussion. Perhaps the United States, would consent in 
the treaty (in case you do not come to some understanding now) to 
leave this particular subject open for discussion at an early period. 
I only suggest this, leaving it to your discretion whether you will 
avail yourself of it, or not. 

Your omission to say anything to Mr Webster on the subject of 
introducing slaves from one Country to the Other, when travelling 
with their owners, as servants, is perhaps, upon the whole well. 
There cannot however be any objection to ascertaining the views 
of the Government of the United States upon this subject, which 
may be best done in personal interviews. If that Government 
seems much averse to such a stipulation, you ought not to hesitate 
to abandon it; but if it is a matter of indifference, with them, the 
opportunity ought not to be lost of securing a privilege, the want of 
which is so serious an inconvenience to the citizens of both countries. 

I have not complied with your request to ''draw out in full form 
^uch a convention as our Government is desirious of intering into,*' 
for the reason that it would be almost a miracle if such an one would

not be so changed and altered in various ways before it could be 
made entirely acceptable to the United States, that it could hardly 
be recognized as the one furnished by the Government; besides this 
it rarely happens that your first demands are all acceded to. You 
must then fall to a second and frequently to a third. If the Govern- 
ment should furnish a project of a convention, it would of course, 
embody its first demands on every point, and if not accepted in that 
Shape, which it would not often be, it would be of little use beyond 
supplying a form, for which of course you do not feel at any loss. 

I enclose as you request a copy of the Treaty with France. This, 
with those you already have, will be excellent guides in many par- 
ticulars. 

A separate commission to make the Treaty is also enclosed. I 
knew the necessity of this; and soon after coining into office, made 
some enqidry about it, and was left under the impression that full 
powers for tiiis purpose had been conferred upon you. 

I think now you are well informed on all the points of a material 
character that we desire to arrange with the United States. There 
are of course minor ones, such as enter into all treaties, that have not, 
been dwelt upon. They are referred to your judgment and discretion. 

I cannot close this communication without mentioning the anxiety 
of the President to accomplish this negotiation with the United 
States so as to lay it before the Congress at its meeting in November, 
or at least, before his term of office expires.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt this morning of your

of a time and place for the meeting of the several Indian tribes. or 
their chiefs for the purpose of entering into treaty stipulations with 
the Government of Texas for the securing and maintaining a perma- 
nent peace with these tribes, with instructions to immediately call 
the attention of the Government of the United States to the subject 
that a commissioner or commissioners might be appointed to act in 
conjunction with the commissioners on the part of Texas to effect this 
object and by which the United States should become a party to such 
treaty or treaties that might be concluded between the parties. In 
obedience to your instructions I have hastened to lay this subject 
before the President and Secretary of War in a personal interview

which I have just had beUevmg that to be the better method, that I 
might explain more fully the objects of the Government of Texas. 
The result of this interview I submit for your consideration. 

The measure is highly approved of by the President and Secretary 
of War and the greatest solicitude is manifested by them both, to 
co-operate with the Govt of Texas in her efforts to secure peace with 
the Indians and give security to the frontiers of both countries; but 
it is the opinion of the Secretary of War that it will not be possible 
for this government to send its agent with the necessary instructions 
in time to enable him to reach the Waco Village by the 9th to 20th 
of February that it would require several days for the Secretary to 
examine the subject and prepare the instructions of the department 
to the Agent which should govern him, that, in fact the leading fea- 
tures of the arrangements to which this Government was to become a 
party must be specifically set forth to the agent in his instructions and 
beyond which he would not be authorized to act. The secretary then 
proposed to submit the same to me for examination and discussion so 
soon as he should determine upon the different points. The secretary 
informed me that Mr Armstrong who is the general Indian Agent in 
that quarter was the individual who would be appointed as commis- 
sioner; that his residence was at Fort Gibson and that thirty days 
would be required to communicate with him, adding five days to pre- 
pare his instructions and twelve days for his traveling to the Waco 
Village would bring it to the 25th of February as the shortest time 
possible at which he could be expected to meet the commissioners on 
the part of Texas with the Indians. The Secretary then urged the 
propriety of a postponement of the Council untill some time in the 
spring. To this I replied that it was important that no disappoint- 
ment should be had. One disappointment having already occurred 
should we neglect the present opportunity we could not rely upon 
another meeting with any degree of certainty and further that antici- 
pating the renewal of active hostiUties with Mexico during the early 
part of the ensuing spring, it was highly necessary to Texas to secure 
peace with the Indians in advance. Upon urging these with other 
considerations the Secretary of War agreed to take up the subject 
forthwith and forward the instructions as early as possible with 
directions that the Commissioner should delay no time in repairing to 
the appointed place. I do not think it possible for the Commissioner 
to reach the Waco Village before the 25th of Feb or 1st of March. I 
have said to Mr Spencer the secretary of war that I thought it possible 
that the Indians might be detained untill that time. I therefore hope 
that our commissioners will be informed of these facts that they may 
act accordingly. It is certainly of the highest import that the 
United States should become a party to such treaties as may be con- 
cluded with the Indians, and that every effort should be used to 
detain them untill the arrival of Mr Annstrong the United States

Commissioner. For this reason I have hastened to lay before your 
department these facts in relation to it. 

I am a little surprised and much regret that not one word is said 
in your communications in relation to the movements of the forces 
under Genl Sommerville,** the action of Congress, the measures of the 
Grovemment or anything whatever save the subject of the contem- 
plated Indian treaties. With the greatest deference to the depart- 
ment I do think that I should have some information from the Grov- 
emment upon such important subjects. Under the instructions of 
your department I have been charged with negotiations of several 
important matters, towards their accomplishment I hope my efforts 
have not been wholy unavaiUng especially those which relate to 
our relations with Mexico and which are directly connected with the 
movements of our forces against that country. Surely to a proper 
discharge of my duties it is important that I should not only be 
informed upon these matters but that such information should come 
from a source upon which I might rely, not the vague rumor of a 
partisan newspaper for this is the only opportunity I have had lately 
to learn anything of Texas. 

I am satisfied that it is only necessary to call your attention to this 
subject. The known intelligence and experience of the Secretary of 
State while acting as the Texian Minister here I hope will be found as 
sure guarantees that in future I shall at least receive a passing notice 
from his department. 

I have not time to communicate other matters which I desire as I 
want to get this in todays mail On tomorrow I will forward another 
despatch to your department in relation to the interposition of this 
Grovemment. I will however take occasion to remark here that a 
movement having been made against Mexico it will alter very mate- 
rially the measures proper to be taken by this Government. Every 
measure should now be used to sustain the efforts of Gren SommerviUe 
by reinforcement or other means within the power of the Grovt — the 
news last night from Mexico says that they are on the eve of a certain 
revolution, the expedition to Campeachy would likely fail — the 
rumor at Vera Cruz was that 3000 Texians were on their march for the 
Rio Grande and every effort was making to give a good account of them 

In great haste I have the honor to be with great respect

»In a conversation which I had with the Secretary of War, upon 
this subject, he informed me that during the last summer he had 
communicated to Major Reily information, which had been reed, 
by the War Department, of the release of two boys who had been 
purchased from the Commanches in the west of Arkansas, at the 
instance of the indian agents in that quarter, and who had been 
captured by the indians in Texas. The Secretary also informed me 
that a description of the youths had been furnished to Maj Reily, 
that the same might be communicated to the Texian Government. 
He further informed me that these youths were under the charge 
of the United States authorities, and that he was very anxious that 
measures should be taken by my Government to receive them. He 
also informed me that two hundred dollars had been paid for each of 
these boys, and that it would be expected, that the Government of 
Texas would refund that amount, besides the ordinary expenses of 
transmission and maintenance. If this matter has not yet received 
the attention of your Department, I hope that it will meet your early 
consideration and action. 

In my communication to the Department of State of the United 
States I informed that Department that I was authorized to draw 
upon the Government of Texas for the ordinary fees (only) of sub- 
sistence and transmission of the captive boy Lyons. In a con- 
versation with Mr. Spencer Secretary of War upon this subject he 
informed me that they had invariably paid to the Indians, various 
amounts as purchase money which it was expected the Government 
of Texas would refund, and desired to know of me if I was authorized 
to draw for such sums so paid: I replied that I was not; that I con- 
ceived such a policy was calculated to stimulate the indians to make 
captives, instead of repressing their aggressions, but that this matter 
should be laid before my Government, and that I entertained the 
opinion that so far as money had been expended, by the United 
States, in good faith, the same would be refunded: while, I was 
satisfied that Texas would deprecate the establishment of such a 
policy. I desire the instructions of your DepartmQjttt upon this 
subject, and hope to receive them at as early a day as possible. 

In my last dispatch you were informed that the United States 
Government would forward instructions to a proper commissioner, 
who should repair immediately to the Waco Village to join at the 
earliest day possible the proposed Indian Council, which is to 
meet at that place. I have now the pleasure of informing you 
that the instructions have been dispatched to Pierce M Butler Esq 
their Indian agent in the West of Arkansas, who is duly 
authorized to represent the Government of the United States, 
in that council. His instructions are not such as I conceived the 
most desirable for the interest of Texas, but yet, I hope if carried

into eflFect will prove beneficial to Texas. I desired that the Com- 
missioner might be authorized to conclude a treaty in the nature 
of an alliance, or upon such terms, as that the United States might 
become a guarantee for the fulfillment and observance of the stipu- 
lations concluded between the Indians and Texas. These several 
matters were submitted and discussed in the Cabinet meeting and 
dissented from by the Government. The objections urged were, 
that it was contrary to the policy of the United States to form 
alliances of such character with any power, and that such a provission 
would hazard the ratification of the treaty by the Senate of the 
United States. I herewith transmit you a copy of stipulations 
which are to govern the United States Commissioner — they are 
based upon the supposition that a treaty is first concluded between 
Texas and the Indian tribes, to which the United States is a witness, 
and at the conclusion of this treaty the United States, Texas and the 
Indians agree to these stipulations, the first of which is not reciprocal 
in its character, and which I informed the Secretary of War, I thought 
would not be agreed to by Texas, but he desired that the same might 
be submitted to my Government, for its consideration, while Mr 
Butler would be directed not to insist upon its adoption, unless 
desired by the Govt of Texas. Should it be objected to, he is author- 
ized to agree to the subsequent stipulations, and omit the first. The 
preamble and stipulations are as follows, 

'* Whereas, there are sundry tribes of Indians inhabiting the 
country in and about Red river, which constitutes the boundary 
line between the United States of America and the Republic of 
Texas, who are migratory and are sometimes found within the 
territories of one Government, and at other times in the territory 
of the other making each in time an asylum and shelter from pur- 
suit, and whereas with a view to establish peace with the said Indians 
and to secure the inhabitants of Texas from the incursions and depre- 
dations to which they are exposed, the Government of that country 
has invited a number of the said tribes to meet in council commis- 
sioners on the part of Texas, and has also requested the Government 
of the United States to be represented at such council, and whereas 
in pursuance of such invitation Delegates and Chiefs from the follow- 
ing tribes have assembled at the village of Waco on the Brazos river, 
namely, Commanches etc etc, and certain articles of a treaty of 
peace and friendship between the people of Texas and the said tribes 
have been agreed to and concluded. 

The United States of America being desirous to promote peace on 
their own borders, and to render all the aid which common interest 
may require to prevent depredations upon the persons and property 
of their own citizens as well as the inhabitants of Texas^ have been

represented at the conclusion of said treaty by their commissioner 
for that purpose, Peirce M. Butler Esq, their Indian Agent for the 
Cherokees, who in their behalf has witnessed the execution of the 
said treaty. Now it is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between 
the said United States of the first part, the Republic of Texas of the 
second part and the Chiefs Braves and Warriors of the said tribes 
of indians of the third part as follows. 

First. 

That the Indians of the several tribes represented by tlie Chiefs, 
Braves, and Warriors who signed this treaty will not commit any 
depredations on the property or any injuries to the persons of any 
whites, Indians, or others living within the jurisdiction of the United 
States and entitled to their protection, and that if any property is 
wrongfully taken from the territory of the United States, or any 
persons entitled to their protection are captured by the said indians, 
or any of them, they will on demand restore such captives and such 
property or will pay the full value of such property, and that upon 
neglect or refusal to comply with this agreement the United States 
by their officers agents and soldiers may pursue such property and 
captives and retake them by force of arms, although they may happen 
to be within the territorial limits of the RepubUc of Texas. 

Second. 

In case any of the said Indians shall bring into the territory of the 
United States any property or persons wrongfully taken, within the 
limits of Texas, the United States engage to render all the aid in 
their power for the return of such property and captives, and for the 
seizure of the offenders who may have brought them within the terri- 
tory of the United States, and they will deliver up to the authorized 
agents of Texas such property and captives and the offenders so 
seized, if such offenders usually inhabit within the limits of Texas, 
and if they usually inhabit within the limits of the United States, 
then, the United States will cause them to be proceeded against and 
punished in the maimer provided by their laws; the Government 
of Texas furnishing proof of the facte that may have taken place 
within ite jurisdiction. 

Third. In like maimer the Government of Texas engages to render 
all the aid in ite power for the recovery and return of any property 
or persons that may have been wrongfully taken by the said Indians, 
or any of them from the territories of the United States, and carried 
into the dominions of Texas, and will cause the persons and property 
so captured to be delivered to the authorized agente of the United 
States, and will cause the offenders to be seized and delivered up to 
such agente, if such offenders usually reside within the limite of the 
United States, but if they usually reside within the boundaries of

Texas, then the Grovemment of Texas will cause them to be proceeded 
against and punished in the manner provided by their laws; the 
United States furnishing proof of the facts that may have occurred 
within their limits. 

(Conclusion of stlpalatlons) 

Should the proposed treaty be concluded, and any of the tribes 
that become parties to the same be Indians of the United States, 
alone, it will be necessary to guard against that portion of the pre- 
amble, which sets forth that these tribes are migratory in their char- 
acter, and by which the United States might obtain an acknowledg- 
ment upon the part of Texas, that these Indians were not of the char- 
acter which the United States were already bound to restrain. And 
here permit me to call your attention to a fact, which has presented 
itself to my mind, which seems to be unknown to the Secretary of 
State, or if known seems to be wholly disregarded by his department. 
It is important that I should know the views of my Government in 
relation to it. I allude to the fact, whether the treaty between Mexico 
and the United States, or any part of the same, is held to be binding 
upon Texas, or upon the United States so far as the same may have 
related to Texas. By the 34th article of that treaty I mean the 
treaty of 1831, it is provided after eight years from its ratification the 
same may be terminated by either party giving notice to the other 
of its intention so to do, after twelve months from the date of said 
notice. From the instructions of Mr. Mayfield late Secretary of 
State of Texas to Mr. Bee, with the communication from. Mr. Amory 
Secretary of Legation, who wrote in the absence of Mr. Bee, to Mr. 
Webster Secretary of State of the United States, which communica- 
tion is dated the 19th. of May A D 1841, 1 learn the facts which have 
induced me to believe that, that treaty has ceased to exist except the 
provision of amity. I submit the following extracts which have 
induced this conclusion. 

[Here follows an extract from Mayfield to Bee, April 20, 1841,** 
beginning with the words, "I am directed " , and ending with the words 
"to the 34th. article of the treaty"; and one from Amory to Web- 
ster, May 19, 1841,* beginning with the words, "the undersigned is 
instructed", and ending with the words, "article 34 of said treaty".] 

I hope to hear from your department the views of Government in 
relation to this subject. 

I have at length succeeded, three days ago, in obtaining a copy of 
the treaty now pending before the Senate. Some of its main pro- 
visions I fear are in jeopardy. I allude to the 4th. and 5th. articles. 
At the suggestion of Mr. Archer I have hastily drawn up unofficially,

for the committee on Foreign relations; of which he is chairman, 
some of the leading arguments which I conceived most likely to 
present the treaty in a fair light before the Senate and impress that 
body with the importance of its .ratification. The communication 
is somewhat lengthy which prevents my sending you a copy I endeav- 
ored to impress the committee with the opinion that if these leading 
features were rejected the fragments would not be worth preserving. 
The late intemaJ difficulties in Texas, and the dissensions among our 
selves I regret to say have added much strength to the opposition 
which is arrayed against this treaty, and I have no doubt have caused 
much of the timidity and reluctance manifested by the United States 
in the formation of an alliance or triplicate treaty with the Indians 
for our mutual protection as before alluded to, while it has induced 
the public mind to rely with less confidence in the Institutions of our 
country. If those individuals, who scatter the seeds of discord, 
knew their baleful effects upon our interests abroad, I feel confident 
that they would sacrifice their motives of personal ambition uponlhe 
altar of their coromon country, and unite with a single purpose imder 
the Single Star for the welfare of the whole nation. The old United 
States Bank, and some of its agents, who are in possession of certain 
Texian bonds, which were purchased by them, are making a heavy 
effort against the ratification of any treaty. I have collected all the 
important facts in relation to these matters, and placed them in 
possession of Senators, who are willing to act upon such matters as 
concern the mutual welfare of both nations in a proper and impreju- 
diced light. 

In my last dispatch I said to yom* Department that in the course of 
a day or two I would write further upon the subject of the interposi- 
tion of this Government. Since the date of that communication, I 
have had frequent conversations with the President and Secretary of 
State upon this subject, which were principally of a strictly confidential 
character, in regard to which, I am only permitted to say that this 
Government, influenced by the most laudable desire to restore peace 
between Mexico and Texas, will not fail to use every means within 
its power, consistent with its honor and high standing as a nation, 
to bring about this desirable result. And here permit me to direct 
your attention to the importance of withholding from the pubUc 
eye, so much of my dispatch No. 93 as relates to this subject. 

It is important, as I conceive, for the interest of Texas that she 
should settle down upon some policy to which she will strictly adhere, 
as far as circumstances will permit, during the pendency of hostilities 
with Mexico. We should determine to act exclusively upon the 
defensive, or determine upon the more vigorous course of making 
war upon Mexico by all the means which we could bring to our aid.

Had the Government persevered in confining its operations at home, 
I am satisfied that the measures, taken to arrest the predatory war- 
fare that had been carried on upon our borders, would have proved 
entirely successful, and that, in future we should have had nothing 
to dread but a formidable invasion of such a character as would have 
been likely to test by a trial at amis the comparative strength of the 
two nations. Such an invasion, however, might have been delayed 
by the revolutionary movements in Mexico, and the hostilities now 
going on between that coimtry and Yucat&n, while such delay, with 
the attendant uncertainty which would hang over our affairs, might 
have continued to retard our advancement, and consequent pros- 
perity that must exist upon the restoration of peace and the termina- 
tion of our difficulties. The Government, however, having given its 
sanction to the partial invasion of the Mexican territory, with a view 
of retaliating for the many injuries which Mexico has inflicted upon 
us, must stand justified in the sight of every impartial mind, though 
this change of policy will materially affect the measures which the 
United States would have conceived herself justifiable in taking 
while our operations were confined at home. Having commenced 
offensive operations, (though necessary to our defence,) the whole 
powers of the Government should be united in their prosecution. I 
think the war, (and my opinion meets with the unanimous concur- 
rence for their [sic] is scarcely a dissenting voice to be found of all 
the intelligent men with whom I have conversed since it was posi- 
tively known that Genl. Sommerville** had gone to the Rio Grande,) 
should be prosecuted not only with vigor but the greatest severity, 
and that Mexico should be made to feel the effects of that vengence 
which has long been restrained; and that interest and safety may 
prompt her to the acknowledgment of that which her disregard of 
right and justice has withheld. 

I am still without information respecting the movements of the 
army, and await with great anxiety the receipt of intelligence con- 
cerning them. 

The intelligence which has recently reached here, of the movements 
of Commodore Jones of the American squadron on the coast of Cali- 
fornia, in taking possession of Monterey a Mexican town near that 
coast, has created some sensation and various surmises are afloat of its 
probable effects upon the relations of the two countries. In a con- 
versation which I had two days since, with a diplomatic functionary, 
who is on terms of great intimacy with Grenl. Almonte Mexican 
Minister, the opinion was expressed by that gentleman in the con- 
versation alluded to, that the Mexican Government would likely 
withhold a portion of the indemnities, which she has lately agreed to 
pay to the United States in order to indemnify herself for the dam-

ages sustained by the taking possession of California by Commodore 
Jones. Something may grow out of ihis.^ 

The last accounts from Mexico State that the Congress had dis- 
persed and that the revolution had thus far progressed without 
bloodshed, and that Santa Anna had every prospect of success. 

Through the medium of a gentleman of high standing, who resided 
many years in the City of Mexico and who is on the most intimate 
terms with Grenl. Almonte, I have been endeavouring to learn the 
views and policy of the Mexican Grovemment towards Texas, and the 
prospects, if any, of a settlement of our difficulties. This gentleman 
has had two or three conversations with (5enl. Almonte, in which the 
latter spoke freely of our relations. As this gentleman is yet prose- 
cuting this matter, and as nothing definite has yet been learned, I 
will reserve this subject for a future communication 

Trusting that I shall soon have the pleasure of hearing from your 
Department I have the honor to be with the highest sentiments 
of regard

116 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Your instructions in a former despatch, and repeated again in your 
dispatch of the 25th. ultimo, with regard to the appointment of a 
commissioner to represent the United States at the proposed Indian 
Council, which is to meet at the Waco Village on the Brazos river, 
has sometime since received my attention and you were informed in 
my dispatch No. 95 of the success of my efforts. 

So soon as your last despatches were received, I immediately called 
upon the President and Secretary of State of the United States, and laid 
before them the intelligence, in relation to the course intended to be 
pursued by the British and French Governments, upon the subject 
of mediation, and expressed to them the desires of my Government, 
that the United States should give the necessary instructions to her 
minister in Mexico, that a concert of action might be had on the part 
of these three great powers. The President and Secretary of State 
both expressed the greatest desire to do aU in their power to further 
the proposed object, repeating at the same time, the facts, which they 
had before coromunicated to me, that their minister in Mexico had 
been instructed, sometime since, to offer to that Government the medi- 
ation of his Government in the settlement of the difficulties between 
Texas and Mexico. Mr. Webster also assured me, that the additional 
information which I had communicated to him should be immedi- 
ately transmitted to Mr. Thompson, their minister, renewing at the 
same time, and urging his attention to the former instructions which 
had been given him upon this subject. I then told Mr. Webster that 
I would inunediately address him a formal communication upon this 
subject, which promise I have complied with this morning,** a copy 
of which you will find hereto annexed. You will discover in this 
communication to Mr. Webster, that I did not confine myself exclu- 
sively to the points embraced in your instructions, but have alluded 
briefly to the compaign across the Rio Grande under the command of 
Genl. Sommerville. I did this upon consultation with Mr. Webster, 
who promised to send a copy of my communication to Mr. Thompson, 
that he might show the same to the Mexican Government, should he 
deem it necessary, and from which he might show that we were driven 
to such course from motives of self defence, and a desire of peace, and 
not the acquisition of territory, or a desire to inflict unnecessary evils 
upon the Mexican people. 

From facts which [have] come to my knowledge, I deemed it proper 
and necessary to make known both to the President and Secretary 
of State here the fact that General Hamilton was neither directly or 
indirectly recognized by the Government of Texas, as its agent to 
transact or negotiate, either treaties, or business of any character, 
which concerned my Government, nor would the services of that 
gentleman be employed, by the Executive in any such capacity. 

a The date of the letter to Webster as printed was January 24; " this momhig" was apparently the 2Stb.

These facts I informed the President and Secretary of State were 
founded upon the instructions from your department." 

I have lately received a communication from the War department 
through the Secretary of State of the United States informing me 
of the measures taken by that Government to interdict the trade 
between the whites and half breeds of the United States and the 
Indians of Texas, a copy of which communication you will find here- 
with enclosed. You will perceive in this communication, that the 
Secretary alludes to complaints which have been made by the Choc- 
taw Indians against the Citizens of Texas residing upon the border: 
I am gratified to receive Mr. Benton's letter upon this subject, as 
it will afford me an opportunity, of showing to the Secretary of 
War that there are two sides to this case, and that our citizens, if 
to blame at all, are not alone in the wrong. A copy of Mr Bentons 
letter will be enclosed to the Department as soon as I have time to 
write the necessary communication.^ 

Since my last dispatch, I have continued to urge the adoption of 
the treaty lately concluded here, and though I have had to combat, 
not only, the prejudices arising from our disorganized condition at 
home, but also the great opposition which arose here, from various 
sources, and to which T alluded in my former dispatches, I have 
now the pleasure to inform you, that, I think there is every prospect 
of a speedy and favorable action upon it by the Senate. I have 
Just had a conversation with Mr. Archer, Chairman of the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, who expressed to me his entire satisfaction, 
and promised to make a report on tomorrow morning. The amend- 
ment which the President desired to be made, I think I shall be 
enabled to have effected, though upon this, I could obtain no satis- 
factory answer, as the Sena<J)rs with whom I have conversed gave 
no definite opinion in relation to it. 

I learn from Mr. Archer that a communication has been made to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate by the holders of 
Texas liabilities. The purport of this communication I was unable 
to learn. Mr. Archer informed me however, that the communication 
had been returned. 

The gratifying intelligence has reached here, both ifrom Galveston 
and Matamoras, that Genl. Somerville is operating with some effect 
upon the Rio Grande. I regretted to learn that some of his troops 
had refused to submit to his orders, and had returned from Laredo. 
The promptness and determination, which characteria^ed the action, 
of Genl. Sommerville upon the occasion, has had a salutary influence 
here upon the public mind. I repeat again the opinion, which I

expressed in my last despatch, (and this view is fully concurred in 
by the friends of Texas who occupy exalted stations in this country 
but whose names I am not permitted to give) that every effort should 
be made by the Government, to sustain this movement of our troops: 
the greater the effect that is produced, and the more formidable the 
demonstration that is made, the stronger will be the arguments, 
which may be used by the powers mutually friendly, why peace 
should be restored between the two countries. 

Mr. Webster informed me in a conversation had with him, two days 
since, in relation to the interposition which had been formally invoked, 
by my Government, that so soon, as the result of the expedition to. 
Yucatan was made known, it was the determination of his Govern- 
ment, to make a representation to the Mexican Government upon 
this subject, in which his Gt)vemment should be inclined to remon- 
strate in strong language, and that a copy of such communication, 
when made, should be immediately forwarded to the French and 
British Governments.

in consequence of its seisure by order of the President of Texas. A 
copy of which I herewith transmit to you 

By an examination of the account you will discover^ that the owners 
claim (as an indemnification for the loss which they contend that they 
have sustained) the sum of ($5,042.50/100) five thousand forty two 
dollars and fifty cents 

In all my correspondence (both orai and written) with this govern- 
ment upon the subject of this claim I have been influenced by a 
sincere and ardent desire that it should be adjusted in such a way, 
as to give entire satisfaction to all the parties concerned 

In pursuance of that desire and not having then been informed of 
the extent of the injury which the owners of the Retrieve have sus- 
tained, I proposed in my note to you of the 30th. of December last 
to take eleven hundred dollars in discharge of all claims against the 
Government of Texas on account of the Retrieve provided the appro- 
priation was made and the amount paid over, but should this proposi- 
tion not be accepted and the amount of Damages be left to future 
investigation the proposition was not to be considered as binding 
upon Captain Means. 

When Captain Means left Galveston he was not apprised of the 
extent of the injury which his vessel had sustained while in the 
service of Texas; he was by agreement to have sent me from Mobile 
the amount of injury so soon as the repairs were made. The first 
intimation which I have received as to the extent of the damages is

Executive at Washington and have been informed by the Secretary 
of State, that that Department had been previously made acquainted 
with the subject through you, and that a correspondence had taken 
place with the Texan Government. 

The claim as made up by Capt. Means, and forwarded you from 
Mobile, amounting to three thousand nine hundred forty two 60/100 
dollars, does not embrace all the charges which the owners of the 
Retrieve beUeve the Texan Government ought justly to allow, and 
in their account accompanying their Memorial to the Executive they 
have made such additional charges as seems to them correct, and 
thinking that you may not have been put in possession of these addi- 
tional items, beg leave to lay before you a dupUcate of the account 
forwarded to the Department of State at Washington. 

In proof of the charge for additional time amounting to eight hun- 
dred dollars, I beg to state that the time of the detention of the vessel 
for repairs is only computed from the 23d July to the 10th. August, 
Whereas it should have been 32 days more up to the 11th. of Sep- 
tember, that being the day when the repairs were completed as 
appears by Port Wardens survey held at Mobile. 

The charge for additional time is proper and reasonable because 
the vessel was unemployed during said period and the delay and loss 
were the direct consequences of the seizure. 

The owners of the Retrieve have not received on account of this 
loss any compensation either by insurance or otherwise. 

I would further state that although the accompanying account is 
made up from the documents and proofs which have been received, 
yet the amoimt falls far short of the whole extent of their loss. 

And in consequence of this unlawful and unjustifiable proceeding 
on the part of the Texan Government not only have the owners suf- 
fered severely a heavy pecuniary loss; but it was without doubt the 
cause of the decease of Capt. Means at Mobile. 

The owners therefore rely upon the Government of their Country 
for protection, and respectfully request that such measures may be 
taken to afford them relief, and compensate them for their loss, as to 
the proper authorities of the Government shall seem best. 

An acknowledgment of the receipt of this is respectfully requested, 
and any information as to the progress of adjustment of this matter 
will be gratefully received. 

I have the honor to be 

Dr. Sir your Obt. Svt.

Sir 

Your communication of the 11th Ult in relation to the claim of 
Capt Means'* would have received an earlier reply but for the accu- 
mulation of business in this Dept. consequent upon the adjournment 
of Congress, which has necessarily engaged my attention 

The amount of eleven himdred Dollars for the use of his vessel and 
the damages sustained, the President directs me to say is admitted to 
be just, and that the same will be iinmediat[e]ly paid out of the appro- 
priation for frontier defence. 

The President further instructs me to say he regrets that the only 
means at his disposal, under the law of Congress are the Exchequer 
Bills, and that he is not authorized to disburse them except at their 
par value. The best therefore which he can do is to offer Capt Means 
the alternative of receiving the amount of his claim in Exchequer 

a February 2, 1843. See Van Zandt to Jones, March 13, 1843.

Department of State, 
WasTiington [Texas,] Feb, 10th, I84S. 
To the Hon. Isaao Van Zandt, 

Charge d' Affaires of Texas etc, etc. 
Sm, 

The subject of the annexation of Texas to the United States, in 
reference to which instructions was given by me to your predecessor 
Mr. Reily I am happy to learn has claimed your early attention, as 
notified to this Department in your Despatch of the [23rd of] Decem- 
ber last, and I now have the honor to transmit you further instruc- 
tions in relation to the same. 

The proposition which was made to the United States in 1837 and 
rejected by that Government places Texas in an attitude which would 
render it improper for her to renew the proposition under existing 
circumstances and you are authorized to intimate in your verbal 
intercourse with the Secretary of State of the United States that 
before this Government could take any action on this subject, it 
would be necessary for the United States Government to take some 
step in the matter of so decided a character as would open wide the 
door of negotiation to Texas, in which event you will be authorized 
to make a treaty of annexation. For this purpose it would probably 
be requisite for the (Jovemment of the United States to review its 
former decision upon the proposition made in 1837, and to reverse 
the same or to take up the subject, de novo, and to submit a proposi- 
tion to this Government, through you or their Minister here to enter 
into negotiations to effect this object. 

In the event the first course should be adopted you will then 
inform the Government of the United States that Texas renews the 
proposition for annexation to that Government, and that you will at 
an early period be authorized to enter into the proposed negotiation 
with ample powers to conclude a treaty in the premises. 

In case the other mode of procedure is adopted you Mdll be simi- 
larly authorized and empowered. 

It is beleived that the present period is favorable for the consumma- 
tion of such a Treaty, on the part of this country, the feeling of the 
people being very unanimous in regard to the same. It would there-

fore seem adviseable that the opportunity should be embraced and 
without delay to effect an object which under present circumstances 
is so manifestly intended to promote the best interests of both 
countries. 

Your dispatch no. 95 was received last evening. No. 94 has not 
come to hand, but is presumed to be in the mail of last week which is 
yet behind having been delayed by the high water of the Brazos. 

As you do not in your dispatch mention, or allude to any letters 
received from this Department I state for your information that I 
wrote you officially under dates of the 23d. 25th. 26th. 28th and 30th 
Deer, and the 23d. and 31st. January last, as also a private letter 
about the 24th of the last month. 

Your request to have a copy of the Laws of Texas sent you has 
been complied with and the copy forwarded by the Hon. Mr. Dainger- 
field. Mr. D. was to have left Galveston for New Orleans on the 
last Steamer, at which latter place he will be delayed some two or 
three weeks, after which he will proceed to Washington City, on his 
way to Europe. 

So soon as your dispatch No. 94 is received I will address you 
again in reply to that as well as to the one received last evening 

If convenient I wish you to procure from the Post Master General 
Copies of such blank forms etc etc. as are in use in the General Post 
Office of the United States; and to forward the same to this Depart- 
ment, for the information of the Bureau of the G. Post Office here 

Enclosed I send you the official report made to the War Depart- 
ment by Gen. Somervell ^ which will place you in possession of all 
the information not heretofore communicated relative to his late 
unsuccessful campaign.

The Commissioners appointed by this Government, Viz. Messrs. 
Terrill * Black Durst and Williains left some time since for the Waco 
Village to hold the Council with the various tribes of Indians, assembled 
there and unless the high waters of the river have prevented, it is 
presumed that the Council is by this time nearly ready to commence 
its deUberations. By a letter reed, from Gen. Terrill at Franklin on 
the Brazos and written, a few days since, the most confident expec- 
tations appear to be entertained by that Gentleman that a Treaty 
will be made and peace established throughout all Texas between us 
and the red man. No intelUgence of the arrival of Gov. Butler, the 
U. States Commissioner has as yet been received, and the presumption 
is that he will come direct from Arkansas to the Waco Villages. A 
copy of that part of your dispatch No. 95 relating to the subject of 
powers given to Mr. Butler by his government has been forwarded to 
our Commissioners, with a notification of his appointment, and instruc- 
tions for their govemanpe in the premises 

For yoimg Lyons and the two boys which have been redeemed 

from Indian captivity by the oflScers of the United States the Presi- 
dent will remimerate the government of the United States upon 
delivery of these captives severally provided the amoimt required for 
each does not exceed $300, which is the amoimt authorized by Law 
to be paid. Should it exceed this amoimt the Government of Texas 
will feel herself boimd to pay the same, although this would require 
the action of the Congress. The friends or relatives of these prisoners 
will it is presimied go for them, which will preclude the necessity of 
dispatching a Govt agent for that purpose. Should any more of om* 
prisoners be redeemed, previous to the formation of a treaty with our

Indians the same course will be adopted. The Indians however have 
promised to bring all our prisoners to the Council ground and to 
exchange them for their own which last have as far as practicable 
been collected and sent there by the President. 

I was somewhat surprised at that part of your communication 
No. 95, where you express the opinion that this Department had 
acted in probable ignorance of the fact that the Treaty between 
Mexico and the United States so far as Texas was concerned had been 
ended in all things relating to Navigation and Conmierce, by a notice 
given to the United States in accordance with the 34th Art. of said 
Treaty, and I am at great loss to imderstand to what particular acts 
you allude. You will perceive that this Department has been aware 
of this fact, by the instructions severally given to Mr. Bee and Mr. 
Riley to negotiate a new treaty and by the fact of Mr. Riley's having 
negotiated the Treaty herein above referred to — and which has been 
matter of frequent communications from this Dpt. to yourself 

The obhgations to observe amicable relations between the two 
coimtries is perpetual, and also the obligations which each owes the 
other to restrain reciprocally their citizens or indians from commit- 
ting injuries or hostile depredations upon the citizens or indians of 
the other. This is an obligation which exists independant of any 
treaty, and grows naturally out of the relative situation of the United 
States and Texas towards each other as neighboring and friendly 
nations. These obhgations have been on several occasions mutually 
acknowledged by the two governments since the expiration of the 
Treaty Stipulations between the two coimtries relating to Commerce 
and Navigation. I however conceive that the Treaty of 1831 so far 
as it relates to these matters is still binding upon Texas^ and the 
United States as no notice has been given by either party of an 
intention to discontinue it in regard to them. But in either event 
the obhgations of the parties are not materially aflfected and the 
only advantage which would arise from holding to the Treaty in the 
particulars refered to would be that it gives a proper and particular 
definition of these obhgations and the precise manner in which they 
are to be mutually discharged 

I regret most sincerely the opposition which the treaty negotiated 
by Mr. Riley has met in the Senate of the U. States and the causes 
which have produced it. The infamous course pursued by some two 
or three of our own newspapers in vilifying and abusing the country, 
its institutions and character, and misrepresenting all the actions of 
the Government I have no doubt have had much influence in pro- 
ducing this unfortunate state of things. I feel satisfied however that 
you will have done every thing in your power to counteract as far

as time and opportunity rendered possible the slanders and the false- 
hoods uttered and circulated through these vile channels or by any 
other means. The licenciousness of a portion of the newspaper press 
in Texas gives cause of deepest mortification to every friend of decency 
and social order in it, and leads them frequently to doubt whether this 
licenciousness is not a greater curse to the country than the hberty 
of the press is a blessing. Certain it is that incalculable injury has 
been done to our cause by the course which some two or three con- 
ductors of papers here have pursued at this moment of peculiar 
national embarrassment. 

The friends of Texas however must not for a moment despair 
She will triumph over every difficulty, and over all her foes internal 
and external. 

The present policy of the government towards Mexico is to stand 
on the defensive This policy has been strictly pursued as far as 
practicable, and will be continued Texas has not the means neces- 
sary to carry on oflfensive operations against her enemy. The late 
Campaign under Gen. Somervell was not projected or recommended 
by the President. It was merely sanctioned to satisfy popular clamor, 
amd as the volunteers under him wished to cross the Rio Grande and 
were determined to do so right or wrong to clothe the expedition 
with legal authority that in case it was unfortunate, and our citizens 
should fall into the power of Mexico they could not be regarded or 
treated by the authorities of that (Jovemment otherwise than lawful 
belligerents acting under sanction of their own Government. 

I have just received a communication from Viscount Crameyel " 
Charg6 d' Affaires of his Majesty the King of the French on the subject 
of the triple interference by France England and the U States, in 
relation to the existing difficulties between Texas and Mexico [a copy 
of which is enclosed] for your information and corresponding action * 

In case Mr. Thompson the United States Minister has not been 
already instructed on the subject, it will be well to bring it to the 
notice of Mr. Webster with a request that it should be done, as early 
as practicable in the event the United States are willing to join the 
other two powers in concerted action.

(Extract.) Washington [Texas], 17th. February, 184S. 

To Hon. Joseph Eve: 

My dear Judge — I find, as news reaches me both from the United 
States and Texas, that the subject of annexation is one that has 
claimed much attention and is well received. I find that even the 
oldest settlers — even some of the original "Three Hundred",* are as 
anxious for the event to take place as any that I meet with. How 
the project is tb ultimate, it is impossible to divine. The democracy 
of the United States is in favor of the measure; and if it should 
become a political lever, both of the political parties will sieze hold 
of or grasp at the handle. But of these matters you can judge better 
than it is possible for me to do. You have more sources of informa- 
tion than I can have. 

Truly thy friend,

Sm 

In my last communication of date the 14th of Feby (N Orleans) I 
had the honour to inform you that having completed the buisness with 
which I was charged at N Orleans I should in pursuance of my instruc- 
tions proceed immediately to Washington. This I did but the Steam 
Boat Queen of the West in which I embarked having snagged and 
simk near Shawnee Town and the ice running very heavily in the 
Ohio I was notwithstanding all my exertions to reach here and my 
not delaying a moment on the route so retarded, that I did not arrive 
at Washington imtill the day before yesterday. Within an hour 
after my arrival I delivered to the Hon Mr Van Zandt, the Treaty 
with which I was entrusted, fortunately notwithstanding its many 
accidents and transhipments in perfect good order; I also delivered 
to him the full copy of the Laws, with which I was directed to furnish 
him. 

The Department of State is of course informed that the treaty has 
not been ratified; this failure I am convinced, not only by what I 
learn here but by information obtained before my arrival is the result 
of our own demagogical madness and diabolical insubordination at 
home. An entire want of confidence in the stability of our institu- 
tions, the result of our own. folly and wickedness forbids the possibihty 
at present of this treaty being ratified. All that zeal the most ardent, 
industry the most untiring and address the most adroit could do in its 
favour has I am convinced been done. Its fate will remain imchanged 
imtill that change be brought about by our own reformation. 
Although I do not feel as sensibly as some others the evils which 
this failure of the treaty may give rise to, Yet the stain which the 
cause of its rejection leaves on the escutcheon of my coimtry is to me 
like a wound to my own personal honour. In its blackness all 
calculations of profit or loss from the commercial stipulations of the 
treaty are lost, and swallowed up. In accordance with yr instruc- 
tions I shall endeavour to convey to the Hon Mr Van Zandt all the 
information with regard to matters at home in my possession. I 
shall await here the arrival of the fidl powers alluded to in yr private 
communication of the 13th of Feby which came to hand last night. I 
have not as yet seen the Belgian Minister but shall do so in a few

some anxiety, to hear from you when and how this just and meri- 
torious claim is to be paid. 

I shall feel much gratified to have it in my power, to Inform General 
Thompson, that the amount appropriated by Congress for his benefit 
is ready for him. It is of much consequence to him to receive it as 
soon as possible in order to relieve himself from his pecuniary embar- 
rassment incured by indulging the kindest feelings to the citizens of 
Texas. I therefore again call your attention to this subject and ask 
for as early a reply as may be convenie[n]t for you to give me.

Despatch No. 97. 

Legation of Texas, 
J\^M7igton [City] 13th March I84S. 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas, 
Sir 

On the 8th Inst I had the high gratification to receive your very 
able and interesting despatches of the 23rd and 31st January and of 
the 10th ulto. enclosing therewith the narative of A Neil Esqr. and 
the orders and instructions given to Genl Somerville for the prose- 
cution of the campaign across the Rio Grande. I regret that these 
despatches have been so long detained by the way, had they have 
come to hand at an earlier day, I should have been enabled to have 
refuted successfully the many misrepresentations which have been 
made here in relation to the different matters of which they and the 
accompanying documents treat. I hope they may yet avail as 
much, though I fear it may be said, that, Slander has performed its 
office — ^its work is complete. 

I have also the pleasure to inform you that the Hon Wm. Henry 
Dangerfield ^ arrived in this City on the 9th Inst and left again on 
yesterday for Baltimore where he will remain a few days and then 
return here. I have learned much valuable information from Col 
Dangerfield in relation to our affairs at home as well as the views 
and policy of the Government with regard to the future, which I 
hope may enable me to direct my efforts so as to meet the concurence 
and sanction of the President and Secretary of State. 

In my last despatch I expressed the hope that an early and favor- 
able action would be had upon the treaty then pending before the

Senate of the United States. This opinion was formed from state- 
ments made to me by the Hon. Mr Archer Chairman of the Committee 
on foreign relations and the views expressed by other prominent 
members of the Senate. The result has however turned out other- 
wise, no action was taken by the Senate untill the last hours of the 
session on the night of the 3rd Inst, when they ratified the treaty 
with an amendment by striking out the 4 and 5th Articles which to 
my mind amounts to a virtual rejection of the whole not that many 
good features are not still retained, but, that it is not the interest of 
Texas at present to conclude any treaty with the United States 
which shall not embrace a provision for the free entrance of our 
Cotton and the imencumbered navigation of those streams which 
take their rise in Texas, and either form the boundary between the 
two countries, or flow into the United States, and empty into the 
Sea within their territory. Nothing can of course be done with the 
treaty further, untill the meeting of the next Congress in December, 
previous to which time, I shall avail myself of an opportunity to 
speak more at length in relation to the treaty as ratified by the United 
States Senate. I send you herewith copies of the confidential note 
of the Secretary of State of the United States and the procedings of 
the Senate as certified by Asbury Dickens Esqr Secretary of the 
same. This result I am very sure will be much regreted by every one 
who feek an interest in the mutual welfare of both countries, but by 
none more than myself, not entirely on account of the loss of the 
treaty itself, though this I deeply lament, but the causes which pro- 
duced this unfavorable determination are more to be deplored. 
When my last despatch was written the inteligence of some internal 
dissentions in the country and army had reached here, but by an 
untiring exertion, aided by the news of the promptness of Genl Som- 
erville's action at Laredo in suppressing the spirit of insubordination 
which had manifested itself there, I was enabled to show to the 
committee to whom the treaty had been refered that the laws and 
constituted authorities were yet supreme, and thereby sustain the 
totering fabric of confidence which had [been] noding to its fall. 
The committee had determined to make a favorable report upon 
the treaty, (but it has been wisely said, we know not what a day 
may bring forth,) soon after this, came the news of the division and 
split of the army, and the disasters which befell Col Fishers Com- 
mand,'^ and with it came the anathemas and abuse which seemed to 
be poured out, without measure upon the Government and Country 
by some of our presses and letter writers, whose eloquence seems 
never so vivid, as when attempting to hold up in derision the consti- 
tuted authorities of the Republic. These things were read and copied

into the newspapers here, and reiterated throughout the land, their 
effects you may readily judge, the efforts of our friends were palsied 
as if by a paralytic stroke, the hopes of our Opponents revived, 
while the remaining confidence which had existed in our institutions 
as if borne down by a mighty avalanche either disappeared beneath 
the ruins or was only seen in the disjointed and weiiened fragments 
of the hopes of our unmoved friends. Mr Archer informed me that 
every Senator who spoke upon the matter in opposition said they 
were willing to grant us by legislative action all the priviledges which 
were c^ded to us in the articles stricken out, but that our apparant 
situation would not justify them in ceding such important provi- 
sions by treaty stipulations and thereby place them beyond their 
control for ten years, if granted by legislative act they could repeal 
it whenever they saw proper should any change take place in our 
affairs which would call for it. Mr Archer also said he would pledge 
himself if desired to bring in a bill at the next session for that pur- 
pose. This and my preceding dispatches will thus give you" the 
history of the matter so far as the same has come to my knowledge 
with the various causes which have operated at different times to 
retard the action of the Senate and to bring about the final result, 
which I have used every exertion in my power to avert. I annex 
for the information of your Department a private communication 
which I addressed to Mr Archer chairman of the conmiittee on for- 
eign relations while the treaty was before the committee. As I 
before remarked further action of course will be suspended untill 
the meeting of Congress in December, if during this time order can 
be restored, the people united, the laws respected, subordination 
prevail, our friends who wield the pen or speak aloud will but talk 
and write in our country's cause and Texas present an undivided 
front I do not entertain a doubt but that the late panic will have 
passed away, confidence be again restored and that the Senate will 
reconsider its vote and adopt the treaty as originally presented, for 
this reason I hope the Senate of Texas will not act upon the matter 
imtill an opportunity is afforded the Senate here to revise its decision. 
I reed at the hands of Col. Dangerfield the ratified Copy of the treaty 
forwarded by him. 

In a former despatch I informed your department that I addressed 
to Mr Webster Secretary of State on the 14th of December last a com- 
munication upon the subject of the character of hostilities waged by 
Mexico against Texas invoking at the same time the interposition of 
the United States to arrest the same and to require of Mexico either 
to recognise the independence of Texas or make war upon her accord- 
ing to the rules of civilized nations. Mr Webster afterwards in a pri- 
vate conversation informed me that the same had been laid before the 
President of the United States who had given it a favorable considerft-

tion and that it was the intention of his Government to seize the ear- 
liest favorable opertunity to make a representation to the Mexican 
govt, upon this subject. Afterwards I reed the note of Mr. Webster 
in reply dated 2nd Feb last informing me that copies of my commu- 
nication of the 14th Dec and 24th Jany had been transmited to the 
Mimster of the United States in Mexico with instructions concerning 
the same A copy of Mr Websters note is herewith annexed. Sub- 
sequent to the date of the reply I was told by Mr Webster in a per- 
sonal interview had at the State Department, that, the Govt of 
Texas having in its late movements towards Mexico acted in viola- 
tion of the policy which ^he had formerly avowed and attempted a 
retaliation for the injuries which had been inflicted upon her, the 
government of the United States could not feel justified to adopt 
the measures which it at first intended. I endeavored to show to 
Mr Webster that any apparant diversion from our former course was 
not to be attributed to the Govt authorities but to individuals acting 
in violation of orders, these thing I was unable to fully establish, for 
the want of authentic information concerning the facts as they existed 
Mr Webster said in reply that it was impossible to draw the distinc- 
tion at all times between those who acted by authority and those who 
acted without, and if such numbers acted not only without but in 
violation of orders it was one of the strongest grounds to prove that 
we were without a government or in other words the (Jovt had lost 
its force. I am much gratified in deed that this matter has reed so 
much of your attention in your last despatches. 1 shall immediately 
address the Secretary of State here upon the subject and enclose 
therewith the narative of A Neill Esqr and a copy of the orders 
directed to Genl Sommerville which must fully (as I conceive) vin- 
dicate the course of the govt in the measures which have been taken. 
Mr Southall bearer of dispatches from the American Minister in Mex- 
ico to the Govt here reached this place a short time since, after his 
arrival I called upon Mr Webster who informed me that Mr Thomp- 
son had approached the Mexican Govt upon the subject of Texas and 
that Mr Thompson reports that all attempts at mediation are wholly 
useless. 

Since my last despatch I have privately and confidentially pre- 
sented the situation of our affairs to the President and one of the 
prominent members of his cabinet and submited to them the pro- 
priety of the United States announcing to the world that the inde- 
pendence of Texas shall be maintained and that the war waged by 
Mexico against us shall cease in toto. I have urged in argument, 
that, it was the aboUtion of slavery which was avowed by Mexico 
as a prime reason for an attempt to resubjugate our country, and 
that this is but an indirect attempt at abolition in this country itnd 
calculated to encourage that growing faction here. Aside from this

the movements of the British Govermnent can not be looked upon 
in any other than a suspicious light towards Texas, the known pol- 
icy of England upon the question of Slavery and the assertions of 
those connected with her Grovemment that equivalents could be 
had by Texas for her slaves if they were freed, show evidently that 
it is a darling project of hers to see established in Texas a free state 
peopled by'Anglo Americans. Could she succeed in this, the history 
of the Southern States would soon be written. To accomplish this 
England knows that Texas must be reduced to the last extremity 
before the question could be entertained. This matter as I before 
remarked was presented to the President and one of his Cabinet con- 
fidentially — the President listened with much attention and replied 
he would take the matter into serious consideration. I afterwards 
on Monday last called to see him when he told me that Mr Webster 
had been directed to approach the French Minister on the subject 
and that if the French Grovemment would unite with the United 
States that he would immediately take an action upon the matter. 
I shall not make any written communication to the United States 
govt, which will state any of the facts just related but will continue 
verbally to ui^e the measure. If the jealousy of this govt can be a 
little more excited, all the points at which they have stickeled would 
be easily surmounted and they would take an open and bold stand 
in our behalf. This course I believe now can alone secure us peace 
from Mexico while Texas remains in her present position as a seper- 
ate Government. In the communication which I shall first address 
the Secretary of State here I shall endeavor in pursuance of your 
instructions to enforce as far as I can the doctrine of the propriety 
of this government interposing to arrest the predetory warfare of 
Mexico against us. I hope that the views which I have laid confi- 
dentially before President Tyler may meet your approbation, should 
they do so I trust I will be favored with the views of your depart- 
ment in relation to the same. I presume that no step will be taken 
upon the subject untill the French Minister can consult his Grovem- 
ment. I will write Dr Smith on the subject by the next packet. 

I am gratified to learn that my efforts on the subject of annexation 
have met the approbation of yourself and his Excellency the Presi- 
dent. I have let no opportunity pass to bring this matter to the 
consideration of President Tyler and his Cabinett who assure me of 
their ardent desire to accomplish that object, the views submitted 
by you in relation to the proposition I most cordially concur in. The 
President informed me in our last interview that I might rest as- 
sured, that, the moment he considered it safe to do so he would 
advise me of the desire of his Govt to enter into the negotiation. 
The President is much embarrassed at this time his principle nomi-

nations having been rejected by the Senate. I allude to Mr Wise 
who was nominated as Minister to France and Mr Gushing to the 
Treasury Mr Wise's sentiments you know in relation to annexation 
Mr Gushing though from the North was pledged to go for it. Mr 
Spencer has succeded to the Treasury Mr Webster will no doubt 
retire in the course of two or three weeks. Some other changes are 
spoken of, after which, when all becomes settled a better oppor- 
tunity will be afforded for operation. Let our people and papers at 
iiome keep silent on this subject, too great an anxiety manifested 
there will only excite opposition here which might otherwise lie 
dormant. GenI Jackson has written an able and interesting letter 
on the subject which will be published in the Globe. I will fo[r]ward 
you a copy as early as it appears.** His influence is paramount with 
Mr. Tyler. 

I will keep your Department advised upon this matter, believing 
as I do, that, it is a subject of absorbing interest both to Texas and 
the United States, and that it is the determination of the administra- 
tion now in power in this country to make the effort to effect it. 

A few days before the adjournment of Gongress John Quincy 
Adams endeavored to offer some resolutions in the House of Beps. 
declaring that no power existed in the constitution authorizing the 
acquisition of foreign Territory and any treaty made to annex Texas 
would be cause of disunion, etc etc. The House refused to receive it 
or consider it. 

On the 3rd ultimo I addressed a communication of [to] Mr Web- 
ster upon the subject of the disturbances between the border citizens 
of Texas and the Indians residing on the boundary near Red River 
enclosing a copy of the extract from Jesse Bentons letter to your 
Department, also submiting the views heretofore contained in my 
instructions upon the subject of the transmission of the mails be- 
tween the two countries. I herewith send you a copy of the com- 
munication which will inform you more fully upon the subject. I 
had previously laid the same before the Post Master Grenl. who in- 
formed me that he was not authorized to require prepayment upon 
letters although he approved of the proposition submitted by me, 
the communication was made in writing that the same might be 
submitted to Gongress — this was done but- 1 regret to have to say 
that it remains I understand among the unfinished business of the 
session. 

Your request in relation to the blank forms of the Post Office 
Department shall be attended to at the earliest day possible. Mr 
Dangerfield delivered me a full copy of the laws for which I return you 
my thanks.

(Copy of communication addressed to Mr. Archer.) 

Washington Crrr 

lOfh. Jany I84S 
Hon Wm. S Archeb 

Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. 

Sm: With your permission I beg leave to submit a few brief 
remarks upon some of the various points embraced in the treaty 
lately concluded in this City between the United States and the 
Republic of Texas. 

The Republic of Texas, having on the 19th day of May A D 1841, 
made known to the United States her intention to terminate the 
treaty of the 5th. of April A D 1831,** between Mexico and the United 
States, so far, as the provissions of the same, relating to commerce 
and navigation were binding upon the Texian Government, conse- 
quently by the provissions of the 34th. article of said treaty, since the 
19th. day of May A. D. 1842, all regulations upon the subjects of 
commerce and navigation have ceased between the United States 
and Texas. 

The contiguity and juxtaposition of the two nations — the frequent 
intercourse between their citizens, and the growing commerce carried 
on between them, render it essentially necessary, in order to avoid all 
difficulties and embarrassments, which might arise, as well as to per- 
petuate and strengthen the good feelings of friendship and national 
concord, which it is the interest and should be the desire of both 
Governments to foster and preserve, that definitive rules, in the 
nature of treaty stipulations, should be established for their mutual 
regulation and government. 

Assuming then, that a treaty is not only proper but necessary, the 
next inquiry arises; what should be its provissions ? In order that it 
may receive the sanction of the people of the two countries, and ensure 
a faithful observance of its conditions, and thereby accomplish the 
objects designed, it should be founded upon the basis of reciprocal 
utiUty and perfect equality. I am aware that in the negotiations of 
commercial treaties, superior facilities and advantages are always 
enjoyed by those who treat at home — this, taken in connection with 
the fact that the Republic of Texas is yet in her infancy, with a 
limited population and her resources but partially developed, it 
might be supposed that she would necessarily be compelled to make 
concessions without receiving an equivalent. But such a view I 
apprehend will not be found correct, it being neither compatible with 
the known independence of the people of Texas, nor the long estab- 
lished magnanimity of policy, which has characterized the Govern- 
ment of the United States. By assuming that the basis, of the nego- 
tiations, between the two countries, as before remarked should be

founded upon the broad and liberal principles of independence, equal 
favors and reciprocity, all the incentives and all the opportunities, 
for over-reaching and double-dealing are thereby discarded and 
thrown aside. Neither Government should ask any thing, which the 
other can have any interest to deny. Neither should offer any thing, 
for which the other may be unwilling to give a fair equivalent. 

I will now compare the treaty which has been concluded," with the 
foregoing principles and see how far (should it be ratified) they will 
coincide. 

The first article provides for a lasting peace and friendship. 

The second article stipulates for a reciprocal liberty of commerce: 
that, ''the inhabitants of the two countries respectively shall have 
liberty to come with their ships and cargoes to all such places ports and 
rivers in the territories of the two countries, to which other foreigners 
are permitted to come, to enter into the same, and remain and reside 
in any ports of the said territories respectively, also to hire and occupy 
houses, and ware houses, for the purposes of their commerce, but 
subject always to the laws of the two countries respectively." This 
although entirely reciprocal in its character will be found in its effects 
to be more extensive in its benefits to the Government of the United 
States than to Texas. From the relative situation of the two 
countries — their great inequaUty of surplus capital, population, 
manufactures and commerce, a greater number of United States' 
ships, merchants and capitalists will always be found engaged in the 
trade and shipping of Texas, than of Texian ships, merchants etc in 
that of the United States. This is an advantage, which the United 
States may enjoy without any detriment to Texas, while such a pro- 
vission by the encouragement and protection mutually guaranteed 
by it to the commerce of both nations, is well calculated to strengthen 
the ties of friendship already existing between them. The last pro- 
vission of this article, withholding the coasting trade of either 
country, being in the nature of a reservation and not a cession, need 
not be noticed here. 

The 1st. provission of article 3rd. places the articles of growth 
produce or manufacture of either country in the markets of the other 
upon an equal footing with like articles imported from any other 
foreign nation. This provission, though in the nature of a mutual 
concession, possesses a prohibitory or negative character much to be 
desired by the United States. Texas is thereby prevented from con- 
cluding any arrangement with any other foreign power (that might 
be desirous of monopolizing her trade), by which the articles of 
growth produce or manufacture of such foreign power might be 
admitted into Texas, on more favorable terms than like articles, the 
growth produce or manufacture of the United States, thereby

guaranteeing to the United States a fair competition with other 
foreign powers in the trade of Texas, which trade must prove highly- 
lucrative to those who shall be so fortunate as to secure it. 

The next paragraph of the same article provides that, ''no higher 
or other duties or charges shall be imposed in any of the ports of the 
United States on Texian vessels, than those payable in the same ports 
by vessels of the United States; nor in the ports of Texas on vessels 
of the United States, than shall be payable in the same ports on 
Texian vessels." This though apparently equal will be found in its 
effects to give to the United States great advantages, while it may 
materially affect the revenues of Texas. The number of Texian 
vessels is remarkably limited and their tonnage generally light, the 
consequent charges upon them in the ports of the United States, 
which would be lessened by this provision, must be trivial in amount. 
On the other hand nearly the whole of the Texian shipments from 
the United States, being made in United States* bottoms, (which 
with other foreign vessels are chained in the ports of Texas sixty 
cents per ton on sail and thirty cents per ton on steam vessels and 
the tonnage duty thus collected from foreign vessels amounting as 
will be seen by reference to the collectors* retVuns of the different 
ports of Texas to near one fifteenth of the whole revenue received,) 
should Texas with a view to encourage and foster her own shipping 
(which has been the poUcy of every Government desiring to be inde- 
pendent) make the same difference in the tonnage duty between 
domestic and foreign vessels, as has been established by the United 
States, for the protection of their shipping, then the gain to the 
United States by the adoption of this provission. must be in propor- 
tion, as the amount of their shipping entering the ports of Texas, 
exceeds the shipping of Texas entering the ports of the United States. 

The 3rd. and 4th. paragraphs, of the 3rd. article provide that the 
same duties shall be collected by either country on the articles of 
growth produce or manufacture of the other, whether the same shall 
be imported into either country by Texian vessels or vessels of the 
United States. This provission will have the effect to reduce the 
duties now levied in the ports of Texas five per cent, upon such 
articles as are imported into that country in vessels of the United 
States, which are the growth produce or manufacture of the United 
States. This will be more fully explained by the following clause 
extracted from the impost laws of Texas, ''An additional duty of 
five per cent ad valorem shall be collected over and above that which 
the laws otherwise direct from all goods imported in foreign bottoms, 
with the exception of those foreign vessels, which by treaty or act of " 
Congress are permitted to enter on the payment of domestic duty". 
Such a provission may likewise be contained in the revenue laws of 
the United States, this however I have not had an opportunity to

ascertain: should it even be so, this provission must still result with 
greater advantage to the United States, in proportion to the amount 
which their exportations to Texas in United States vessels exceed 
the exportatifons of Texas to the United States in Texian vessels, 
which excess as has already been shown is very great in favour of the 
United States. 

The last paragraph of the 3rd. article, relates to drawbacks upon 
the exportation of goods the growth produce or manufacture of either 
country, and when reexported from either country in the vessel of 
the other party to any foreign nation, the party from whose country 
such reexportation is made, reserves to itself the right, of regulating 
or diminishing the amount of the said drawback. This provission 
though important for the future, at present would be very limited 
in its effects upon either country. It is not probable that any 
exportation will be made to Texas from the United States, for some 
time to come with a view of reexportation by river or sea to any other 
foreign nation. The only case, in wliicli this provission will probably 
operate, will be in the exportation of the products of Texas to the 
United States, and from thence to be reexported to Europe. By the 
adoption of this provission the United States will have the power to 
diminish the drawbacks allowed to such an extent (when the re- 
exportations are made in Texian vessels) as may amount to a pro- 
hibition, and thereby secure to themselves the carry ing trade of all 
articles the growth, produce or manufacture of Texas so reexported. 

By article the 4 th. "the two contracting parties agree that theSabine 
from its source to the sea, the Red river and all rivers, having their 
sources or origin in the territory of Texas, running in part of their 
course through that territory, or forming the boundary between Texas 
and the United States and emptying into the Mississippi, and the 
Mississippi itself, from and including the mouth or mouths of said 
rivers to the sea, shall be free to be navigated and common to both 
nations, and that no duty shall be levied or collected upon any arti- 
cles the growth, produce or manufacture of Texas, originally trans- 
ported down the above named rivers, or transported for the purpose 
of descent and exportation to any port or places situated thereon, 
provided however, that it shaU be lawful for the Presidents of the 
United States to establish such rules and regulations, as may be neces- 
sary, for the proper observance of the stipulations contained in this, 
and the next succeeding article." In this article the right of entrepot 
is indirectly ceded to Texas, but as the same is more fully couched in 
article 6th. I will pass it over for the present, and confine myself to 
'the remaining stipulations of the article above set forth. 

The privilege, of the navigation of the several streams before 
alluded to (which take their rise in Texas) throughout their whole 
course to the sea, cannot be considered as a cession on the part of the

position I presume no one will attempt to controvert: should it how- 
ever be doubted, the doctrine heretofore held by the United States, 
during the controversy with Spain in 1792 in regard to the rigjit of 
navigating the Mississippi within the Spanish territory," as well as 
the doctrine afterwards held by the United States, in the controversy 
with Great Britain in relation to the navigation of the St Lawrence, 
which both takes its rise and empties into the sea within the British 
territory,'' will establish the principle upon which this right is founded. 
This right is rested upon the principle, that the Ocean is free to aU 
men, and its rivers to all their inhabitants — that whenever these rivers 
enter the limits of another nation, from that in which they take their 
rise, or through which they flow, if the right, of the upper inhabitants 
to descend the stream, shall be in any wise obstructed or denied, it is 
but an act of force by a stronger society against a weaker condemned 
by the judgment of mankind. It is also a principle that the right to a 
thing gives the right to the means without which it could not be used, 
that is, the means follow the end, and the right to navigate a river 
draws to it a right to moor vessels to its shores — to land on them in 
cases of distress, or for other necessary purposes. This principle is 
founded in natural reason and evidenced by the common sense of man- 
kind. Mr Jefferson, in his instructions to the United States' Minis- 
ter in Spain, in 1792, contended that this incidental right extended 
even beyond the shores, when circumstances render it necessary to 
the exercise of the principal right. The only modification which this 
right admits of, is when its free use would conflict with the safety and 
convenience of the nation through which the upper inhabitants are to 
pass. Hence arises the power to establish rules for its government 
and exercise. But then it is a right as real as any other right how- 
ever well defined, and should it be refused or so shackled, by regula- 
tions, not necessary for the peace and safety of the lower inhabitants, 
as to render its use impracticable, it would be an injury for which the 
party injured should be entitled to redress. The law of nature, in its 
great outlines, though suflBciently understood, does not always reach 
the minuter and more compUcated details necessarily called for by 
the various wants of commerce and navigation: for this reason, the 
ocean itself has been subjected in many instances, by numerous 
treaties, to various regulations. The power to prescribe these rules 
has been delegated by this article of the treaty to the President of the 
United States. The free navigation of the streams before alluded to, 
as now contended for, wiQ possess none of the difl5culties suggested — 
the exercise, of this right so far from endangering the peace and safety 
of the inhabitants of the United States, situated and residing upon

these streams below where they emerge from the territory of Texas, 
would on the contrary greatly promote their interest and contribute 
to their wealth. 

By article 5th. the two contracting parties agree that on all articles 
the growth produce or manufacture of either country, sent from one 
country to the other by land, river or sea and exported to a foreign 
country no duties or charges shall be required to be paid to the 
power within and from out of whose limits such articles arrive and 
depart: that they may be repacked for exportation, under the 
inspection of the proper authorities, and at the expense of the party 
interested, and that raw cotton the produce of either country may 
be imported into other free of duty for five years, from the exchange 
of the ratifications of this treaty." This article in a commercial 
point of view may be considered as perhaps the most important 
embraced in the treaty. In order to understand the advantages — 
the policy — the faime^ and equality of its provissions, it is necessary 
to examine and compare its probable effects, upon the various inter- 
ests of the two countries. The geographical position of Texas — 
the habits and pursuits of her people — her principal population 
being at present embraced between 28 and 34 degrees of north lati- 
tude and her soil being well adapted to the production of the great 
southern staple, mark her's as emphatically an agricultural coxmtry. 
The only articles which she may expect to export will be her agricul- 
tural products: the great item of which, and perhaps the only one 
to any extent for the present will be the article of raw cotton. Texas 
then, by the provissions of article 5th, would secure to herself the 
privilege of discharging and repacking for re-exportation, under the 
inspection of the proper authorities, at the ordinary expense attendant 
upon the same, her cotton destined for European markets, and the 
additional privilege of disposing of the same for the term of five years 
within the limits of the United States free of duty. A large portion 
of the citizens of Texas having emigrated from the United States — 
the habits, language and religion of the two countries being the same, 
and the institutions of the former having been derived from the latter, 
it is but natural to suppose, that the people of Texas, should prefer 
and desire to carry on their principal trade with the citizens of the 
United States, when they can do so, without material detriment 
to their commercial interest. The limited amoimt of her shipping, 
and consequent limited means of conveyance within herself render 
it the interest of Texas to procure a market for her products as near 
home as possible, and thereby obtain a speedy return for these 
products, and a ready supply of such articles as she may desire to 
purchase abroad, and import into her own country for consumption. 
This object may be said to be attained in a great degree for the next 
five years, by the provissions of this article of the treaty, after which

the privilege of selling Texian cotton in the markets of the United 
States free of duty would expire by its own limitation without a 
notice of a desire to terminate it by either party. The right of 
entrepot and repackage ceded by this article would result with much 
convenience to the people of Texas, so long as their principal trade 
shall be confined to the United States, especiaUy that portion of our 
citizens residing in eastern Texas, whose outlet to market must be 
through the channels of the various rivers aUuded to in article 4th: 
their natural right being confined as before stated, to the privilege 
of free navigation without that of entrepot and repackage, under 
ordinary circumstances. The question is then presented, Can the 
United States cede to Texas these privileges without detriment to 
their interests? or will they not by these reciprocal stipulations 
greatly advance and promote their individual and national wealth? 
The only objection which has been attempted to be urged, but which 
upon examination will be found to be entkely groundless, is, that by 
the admission of Texian cotton in the markets of the*United States 
free of duty an imdue competition would thereby exist which would 
be detrimental to the cotton growing interest of the United States. 
If the United States were the only consumers and manufacturers of 
raw cotton, this objection would hold good, but it will be recoUected 
that the United States are not only consumers of the raw material, 
but are exporters to a much greater extent, consequently it matters 
but little so far as the cotton growing interest of this country is 
concerned, whether Texian cotton is met in the markets of this 
country, or competed with in the markets of Europe, in fact the mar- 
kets of Europe, with regard to the article of cotton, control the price 
in the markets of the United States, and therefore any competition 
it matters not how formidable that may arise in the article in the 
ports of the United States, can have no effect upon the current 
prices of that great and leading staple. 

The tonnage duty, now levied by the French and English Grovem- 
ments in their ports on vessels of the United States, when freighted 
with Texian cotton, is established at a rate so high that the tonnage 
in many instances would amount to more than the ordinary freight 
of the vessel, and consequently has the effect of a prohibition. The 
entire crop of Texian cotton sent to European markets under the 
existing state of affairs (it matters not whether the same is shipped 
from the ports of Texas direct or reexported from the ports of the 
United States) is now compeUed to be carried on board of European 
ships. It will be readily seen that by the admission of Texian cotton 
into the ports of the United States free of duty, the same would lose 
its identity and become mixed with and shipped as United States 
cotton, which taken in connection with the provissions of a former 
article would undoubtedly secure to the United States the carrying

trade of Texas, by which a profitable employinent will be had for a 
large number of their merchantmen, which would otherwise be 
secured by Eiux)pean ships. The United States would not only 
secure the carrying trade, but would become the great store-house 
from which Texas would procure nearly the whole of her foreign 
supplies, which have heretofore exceeded the amount of her exports. 

The great manufacturers of the north would here secure against 
European competition (for such would undoubtedly be the eflFect) 
a growing and extensive market for the various articles manu- 
factured by them, such as cotton fabrics of every character, lindseys, 
jeans, broad cloths hats boots and shoes and articles manufactured 
from steel and iron, including fire arms, implements of war, farming 
utensils and implements of husbandry; also the various articles of 
furniture etc manufactured of wood — ^glass and tin ware saddlery 
etc etc etc, while the farmers and planters of the west would find 
consumption and a market for their immense quantities, of surplus 
produce, such as flour, bacon, lard etc, thereby giving both in the 
north, and west profitable employment to a large number of laborers, 
who must otherwise remain idle and unemployed. Thus it may be 
seen that this cession of privilege to Texas will not only act without 
detriment to the United States but will result directly to their great 
and eminent advantage. 

The privilege of entrepot and repackage is not exclusive, but 
entirely reciprocal and opens to the enterprise of the United States 
through the territory of Texas extraordinary inducements. The 
United States, imder the provissions of this article of the treaty, 
would possess the right to ship the articles of growth, produce or 
manufacture of every character, of their own country to Texas with 
a view of reexportation free of charge or duty, thereby opening a 
highway to their citizens to the extensive &nd lucrative trade of 
the States of Eastern Mexico, being the nearest route by which many 
of those states can be reached; the most wealthy, of which, must 
from their pecuUar locality, sooner or later, receive their supplies 
through Texas. I aUude to the northern portion of the States of 
Tamaulipas and New Leon, together with the whole of Durango, 
Coahuila and Chihuahua. This view of the case is neither vissionary 
nor ideal. While Texas constituted an integral part of the Mexican 
Nation, a most extensive and lucrative trade was carried on by the 
citizens of the above named Mexican states, with the city of San 
Antonio, and the various villages upon the western border, and even 
since the independence of Texas, and during the pendency of hostih- 
ties between Mexico and Texas, in the years 1838-9 and 40 not less 
than one hundred thousand dollars in gold and silver was annually 
brought into Texas by Mexican traders and exchanged for articles 
of merchandise. It will be recollected also that in the fall of 1840

a caravan of traders, from the State of Chihuahua passed through 
Texas and descended Red river and the Mississippi to New Orleans, 
carrying with them nearly two hundred thousand dollars in the 
precious metals, which were exchanged in that city principally for 
dry goods. These traders returned by the route which they had 
come, being through that portion of Texas included in the counties 
of Red river and Fannin. The Americans, who accompanied that 
expedition, and have since returned, report the route as not only 
practicable, but easy to be traversed. If then such has been the trade, 
imder the circumstances which have existed in that quarter, it might 
reasonably be concluded that should the difficulties between Texas 
and Mexico be happily terminated, this trade would become one of 
gEeat importance. From these reflections I conclude that the pro- 
vissions of this article are not only necessary but higlily beneficial 
to the interests of both coimtries. Nothing is ceded to Texas which 
it is the interest of the United States to deny. Nothing is offered 
to Texas for which she does not render a fair and full equivalent. 

The 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, articles provide for 
the regulation of the commerce between the two coimtries, during 
the pendency of a war in which either of the contracting parties 
may be engaged, whilst the other is neutral, which is highly neces- 
sary for their mutual protection. As these articles contain nothing 
more than the ordinary stipulations, usual in such cases, I deem it 
unnecessary to allude to them in detail. 

The 13th. article provides that the citizens of either coimtry shall 
have power to dispose of their personal effects by sale, donation, 
testament or otherwise, and that their representatives, being citizens 
of either country, shall succeed to the said personal effects, whether 
by testament or ab-intestate, and may take possession thereof, either 
by themselves or their agents, upon paying the ordinary expenses 
etc. This together with the succeeding article, which secures protec- 
tion to the persons and property of the citizens of each country while 
in the territory of the other, as well as opening the tribunals of justice 
for the judicial recourse of the citizens of one country, in the Govern- 
ment of the other, upon the same terms as are usual and customary 
with the citizens of the country where the court is established, are 
important in order to secure to the inhabitants of both countries their 
proper rights, and provide for the numerous cases that daily arise. 

The 15th. 16th. 17th. and 18th. articles provide for the admission 
reception and government of consuls and vice consuls. 

The 19th. and 20th. articles provide for the suppression of hostili- 
ties among the various tribes of Indians, resident upon the western 
frontier, and for the return of captives taken by the Indians of one 
country, and carried into the territory of the other. These provis- 
sions are the same, as have heretofore existed between Texas and the

United States, and which have been productive of great mutual benefit 
to both countries. Interest and justice to the citizens of both coun- 
tries, as well as humanity to the Red man demand their ratification. 

The 21st. article provides for the apprehension of the criminals of 
one country, who have fled to the territory of the other. National 
justice, as well as the interests of humanity, calls for such a regula- 
tion. By its ratification my own country will be enabled to repel 
an imputation, which has heretofore been made, and which was as 
false as it was unfounded. 

The last article provides the manner of its ratification. 

I have thus briefly noticed some of the leading features of this, the 
first treaty of navigation and conmierce, which has been concluded 
between the United States, and the Republic of Texas. Taken in 
detached parts some of its provissions may present some inequalities — 
taken as a whole it may be considered perhaps as equal, under all the 
circumstances, and relative situation of the two countries, as could 
be expected. Should any of its leading features be rejected, I am 
satisfied that the fragments would not be worth preserving. Should 
it be ratified as a whole, I feel confident it will advance the mutual 
interest of both nations. The trade of Texas will be thrown into that 
channel in which the citizens of Texas desire it should go. The United 
States will have secured the trade of a growing and rapidly increasing 
market, which will prove a source of wealth to their merchants, 
producers and manufacturers, and a profitable and lucrative employ- 
ment to their shipping. 

I have the honor to be with high consideration 
Your very Obedient Servant

No. 98. Legation of Texas 

Washington City 

April 6th. I84S 
Honorable, Anson Jones 

Secretary of State. 
Sm 

In my dispatch to your Department of the 13th. ultimo, in alluding 
to the amendments made to the treaty, by the Senate of the United 
States, I expressed the opinion, that, if a proper course were pursued 
by oilr people at home, confidence would again be restored in this 
country, and at the next session of Congress we might have reason to 
hope that the treaty would be ratified in its original shape, and that, 
therefore, the Senate of Texas should not act again upon the matter, 
until the Senate here had had an opportunity to revise its decission. 
So far as the course, proper to be pursued, was alluded to, as men- 
tioned above, I am now of opinion that I was partially in an err^r, 
and that the Senate here will take no action upon the same, until the 
treaty has been submitted to the Senate of Texas, with a view to its 
concurrence in the amendments proposed. Should the Senate of 
Texas refuse to concur, my present impression is that a new convention 
will have to be formed, of this however I will speak at another time, 
my present object being to coiTect the error of my former hasty 
suggestion, which was not properly scrutinized at the time it was 
indited. While on this subject, I will state for your information that 
a few days since it was made known, to me, by a gentleman who 
represents himself as being the holder as well as the agent of others 
who are holders of a large amount of Texas treasury notes, (this 
gentleman was introduced to me by a letter from Mr. Webster) that 
these holders, of our liabilities, intended to call upon the Grovemment 
of the United States to require of the Grovemment of Texas to make 
some provission, for the liquidation of their claims, or some arrange- 
ment, by which these notes should be receivable again, as heretofore

for public dues, at certain stipulated periods of time, say, one, two, 
three, and four years. This gentleman further stated to me that he 
had made a written communication, to the Secretary of State, upon 
this subject, which was submitted to Mr. Archer, chairman, of the 
Committee on Foreign Relations, being the same to which I alluded in 
a former dispatch. He also stated that he had lately called the 
attention of Mr. Webster, and several Senators to this subject, all of 
whom, he said, concurred with him, that should another treaty, or 
convention be concluded between the two Governments, such treaty, 
or convention ought to contain a stipulation, for the adjustment of 
these liabilities. In reply to these remarks, I said, to the gentleman, 
that I had no instructions from my Govemident upon this subject, 
but if I had, of course, I could take no oflBcial notice of his propositions, 
unless the same were presented to me through his Government, but as 
a private citizen, of Texas, I would say that while that Government 
felt every disposition to meet its liabilities, at the earliest day possible, 
I felt very certain that such a provission, as had been intimated, by 
him, neither could, nor would be adopted. He then desired to know 
of me, if I would have any objection, to his making, to me, a written . 
communication, in relation to this subject. I replied that he could 
do so, if he thought proper, and that any communication, which he 
might make to me, I would take pleasure in submitting to my Govern- 
ment, for its consideration. He then said, on leaving, that I should 
hear from him soon. 

If the communication be made I will forward it to your Depart- 
ment as soon as received. No allusion has been made, to this subject, 
by Mr. Webster, in any of our late conversations, but I thought it 
proper to give you the substance of the foregoing conversation, some- 
what in detail that you might form your own conclusions therefrom. 

On the 23rd. ultimo, I addressed, to Mr. Webster, a communication, 
upon the subject of our Mexican relations, enclosing copies of the 
orders given to Genl. Somervell, and the narative of A. Neill Esq., 
which I had received from your Department. I herewith send you 
a copy, of the communication refered to. The objects, of which, as 
you will perceive, were to correct the erroneous impressions, which 
had been made here, in relation to the late movements of the Grovem- 
ment of Texas, and to place it in its proper light; and to again impress 
upon the Government, of the United States, the propriety, of a prompt 
and eflBcient interposition upon their part, in arresting the war 
between Mexico and Texas; and to secure a proper treatment to 
those of our countrymen whom the fortunes of war had placed, as 
prisoners, in the power of Mexico. In relating the details, of the 
treatment, which had been extended by Texas, to those Mexicans 
whom she had taken prisoners, and the contrast which had been 
presented by Mexico, in the infliction of numerous outrages, upon

our citizens, who had been captured by her, I have copied principally 
the language used in my instructions, from your Department, believ- 
ing them to present the facts in their clear and most forcible light. 
Up to the present time I have received no reply to this communica- 
tion. Mr. Webster is now absent for a few days on a visit to Boston. 
At Mr. Webster's request I gave him a copy of the letter of the French 
Charg6 de' Affaires to your Department. 

In your Dispatch to me of February 16th. you make the following 
remark, in reply to my Dispatch number 95, which had been received 
at your Department, viz. ''I was somewhat surprised at that part of 
your communication number 95, where you expressed the opinion 
that this Department had acted, in probable ignorance of the fact, 
that the treaty, between Mexico and the United States, so far as 
Texas was concerned, had been ended in all things relating to navi- 
gation and conmierce, by a notice given to the United States, in 
accordance with the 34th article of said treaty; and I am at a great 
loss to understand to what particular acts you allude." In order that 
you may know upon what my opinion was founded, I would respect- 
fully call your attention to the following extract, from a Dispatch 
received from your Department, of August the 19th. 1842, viz. "The 
right, of Texas, to require this prohibition, on the part of citizens of the 
United States, is clearly deducible from the 33rd. article of the treaty, 
of Amity, navigation, and commerce, concluded etc." In the following 
paragraph you say "This treaty is in full force. Texas was, at the 
time it was concluded, a component part of the Mexican confederacy. 
She has never repudiated the treaty, nor disregarded its provisions 
etc. etc." An examination, of these extracts, I am sure, will lessen 
your surprise, and I think convince you that they furnish sufficient 
grounds for the suggestion, or the opinion, which was expressed by 
me, in my Dispatch No. 95. I concur with your Department, upon 
further examination, that the provission, in relation to Indians, con- 
stituting one of the features of amity embraced in the treaty, is yet 
in force, but in the dispatch of Your Department, of the 19th. of 
August, your remarks are not confined to the provission of amity; 
you say in imequivocal terms ' ' This treaty is yet in fuU force ' ' . Another 
fact I will state, which strengthened the opinion, which I expressed, 
it is this, that no measures had been taken to enforce that provission 
of our revenue laws, which provides that an additional duty of five 
per cent shall be levied, upon all articles shipped, or imported in for- 
eign bottoms, with the exception of those foreign vessels, which by 
treaty or act of congress, are permitted to enter, on the payment of 
domestic duty. If then, there exists no treaty stipulations, in regard 
to navigation and commerce between the two coimtries, I am at a 
loss to know why this additional restriction has not been enforced, 
against the commerce of the United States. The fact, that the same

has not been enforced, certainly affords grounds for the suggestions 
which I made. I am aware that the collection of the revenue is not 
under the control of your Department, but at the same time it was 
to be presumed that so important a fact, as that, could not have 
escaped your attention. In making the suggestion, that it was prob- 
ably unknown to your Department that the notice to terminate the 
treaty had been given to the United States, it was not my intention 
or wish to impute '' Ignorance' ' to your Department, (that is the word 
used by you,) but knowing the fact that the records of your Depart- 
ment were at Austin, and that it was impossible for you to refer to 
them, I thought it probable that the same might have escaped your 
notice. This I hope will suflBciently disclose the causes which led 
me to make the remarks alluded to by you in your dispatch of the 
16th. of February last, and satisfy you of their then apparent pro- 
priety.

I will write to you again, in the course of next week, by which time,

Legation of Texas, 
Washington City March 83rd, I84S 
The undersigned, charge de Affares, of the Republic of Texas, had 
the honor, on the 14th. of December last, to lay before Mr. Webster, 
Secretary of State, of the United States, and invite his attention 
to the character of hostilities waged by Mexico against Texas, which 
was believed to be violative of those rules of civilized warfare, which 
had received the impress of wisdom, and been sanctioned by the 
ennobling and enlightened principles of humanity; invoking at the 
same time the interposition, of the Government of the United States, 
to arrest the same. Subsequent to the date, of the communication 
just alluded to, in a personal interview, the undersigned was informed 
by Mr. Webster that the same had been submitted to His Excellency, 
the President, of the United States, who had given it a favorable 
consideration; and that it was the intention of his Government to 
seize the earliest favorable opportunity to make a representation 
upon the subject, to the Mexican Government. On the 2nd. ultimo, 
the undersigned had the honor to receive the note of Mr. Webster 

a Here follows a list of the books and other property of the legation.

in reply to his, by which he was informed that a copy, of his communi- 
cation, of the 14th. of December, had been communicated to the 
Minister of the United States at Mexico, with instructions from the 
Department of State in relation thereto, the nature of which was 
not intimated. Since this reply, in an interview had at the Depart- 
ment of State, the undersigned was informed by Mr Webster that 
the late movements of the forces of Texas, having exhibited an appar- 
ent inconsistency with the principles, which the Government of 
Texas had avowed should govern its action; and partaking of that 
character of warfare, against which, it had protested, and which 
the interposition of the United States had been invoked to arrest; 
that, therefore, his Government would necessarily be constrained 
to suspend the measures, which it had designed to take, and which 
it would have deemed proper to adopt towards the contending 
parties. The undersigned listened with much regret to the opinion 
thus expressed, and though conscious of the incorrectness, or the 
imperfect view of the data, upon which this conclusion was foimded, 
yet, for want of authentic information, the undersigned was then 
unable to present a full statement of the facts, which would explain 
the nature of these movements, and vindicate his Government from 
the supposed inconsistency. The undersigned has now the grati- 
fication to make known to Mr. Webster, that he has received, from 
his Government, oflBcial information of the causes, which gave rise 
to the campaign, and the orders and instructions given to Brig-Gen 
Somervell for its prosecution, to all of which the attention of Mr. 
Webster is most respectfully invited, with the fullest confidence that 
they will show that the Government of Texas has not abandc^ned 
its former ground, nor given its sanction to any act, at variance 
with its previous declarations. 

In my communication, refered to, of the 14th. December last, 
it was made known to Mr. Webster, that in the course of that year, 
no less than three predatory marauding incursions, to Texas, by 
Mexican soldiery, had been made, under the orders of the Govern- 
ment of Mexico. Our peaceful citizens have been plundered, by their 
troops in some instances, in others captured and imprisoned, and 
again, in others murdered, with the most savage inhumanity, in 
cold blood. On account of these injustifiable enormities and cruel- 
ties, inflicted upon our people, a feeling was aroused throughout 
the country, which caused an assemblage of a large number of our 
citizens at Gonzales, one of our western towns, in the month of 
October last, determined to avenge the injuries and murders, which 
had been committed upon their friends. From the indications that 
were given, the President became satisfied that the people, of the coun- 
try, were exasperated to a degree, which it would be at least diffi- 
cult to restrain, even should propriety require it to be done. Under

this conviction Brig-Gen SomerveU, of the Texas militia, within the 
limits, of whose Brigade the citizens had assembled, was ordered to 
assume the command, and, in case a suitable force should muster 
into service, to pursue the enemy across the Rio Grande, for the pur- 
pose of chastising them; observing in every case the rules of civi- 
lized warfare, and exercising great humanity towards the common 
people. 

For the further information of Mr. Webster upon this subject, 
the undersigned has the honor herewith to transmit copies, of all 
the orders given by the President and Secretary of War of Texas, 
to Brigr. Gen Somervell, for the conduct of the campaign. (See 
copies of orders addressed to Gen SommerveU.*) Under these orders, 
the army, about seven hundred strong, Was organized by Brg.-Gen 
Sommervell, and marched from the Medina on the 25th. of Novem- 
ber last, in the direction of Laredo, at which place it arrived and 
[which it] took possession of, without resistance, on the 8th. of the 
succeeding month; the troops stationed there having fled with pre- 
cipitation, on the approach of Gen Somervell. From this place, 
a part, of the men, about 200, returned home; the remainder, under 
Gen Somervell, marched on the 10th. from Laredo and crossed the 
Rio Grande near Guerrero on the 14th., in the presence of GenCanales, 
who, with about 400 men, was stationed on the opposite side of 
the river. Gen. Canales, with his forces, immediately fled, and the 
town of Guerrero surrendered. On the 18th., the army repassed 
the river in safety, and on the 19th. Gen Somervell, not deeming it 
prudent to remain longer, and being in want of provissions, clothing 
and ammunition, concluded to return. The order was then given 
to return to Gonzales, and the march was accordingly commenced, 
by about two hundred men, who returned to their homes. The 
balance remained in camp, and having elected Wm. S. Fisher com- 
mander, in violation of Gen Somervell's order, recrossed the Rio 
Grande, and entered the town of Mier on the 23rd, On the 24th., 
a smart skirmish ensued between this party and a. Mexican force, 
when the latter were repulsed with loss. On the 25th they were 
attacked at day Ught, by about 1500 men, and after having fought 
very gallantly until ten o'clock, a parley ensued, and they were 
induced, by assurances that large reinforcements, of Mexicans, were 
at hand, and promises of safety, to surrender under stipulated 
articles. 

Throughout the whole march, of the forces, while under the com- 
mand of the properly authorized commander of the expedition, 
every individual act of impropriety or violence, upon the property 
of the peaceful Mexican citizens, was restrained, when it was possible

to be done, or punished if committed. Private property and per- 
sonal rights were, in every possible instance, secured to the enemy's 
citizens, and none were taken prisoners. 

The objects of the Government, it will thus be seen, were legiti- 
mate — the pursuit and chastisement of the enemy. The orders, 
given for the Government of the campaign, and every act, done in 
pursuance of those orders, and with the sanction of tlie constituted 
commander, of the expedition, if submitted to the severest scrutiny, 
the undersigned confidently beUeves will show that his Government 
has not abandoned, nor departed from the high policy, which it had 
avowed its determination to pursue. 

The undersigned is aware that his Government, in asserting the 
rights, acknowledged to belong to civilized nations, and the princi- 
ples, which should govern them, in their mode of warfare towards 
their enemies, should give assurances, of a strict observance of those 
rights and principles, itself. That it has always observed them 
heretofore, the history of our revolution, abundantly proves; and 
the imdersigned is instructed to assure the Government of the United 
States, that any departure, from these principles, should it be at- 
tempted, will not be sanctioned by his Grovemment. That there will 
be lawless persons in every community, who, setting laws and author- 
ity at defiance, persist in a violation of good order and propriety is 
certainly true. In a country like Texas, whose civil Institutions 
have not been matured by time, and by the enjoyment of peace and 
national tranquihty, whose citizens are liable to strong excitements, 
and driven to desire vengeance and retaliation, upon an enemy, with 
whom that country is at war, and from whose soldiery the most 
wanton, flagrant and cruel injuries have been long received and 
endured, and whose inhuman acts have been sanctioned, by the 
Grovemment of Mexico, it is but natural to suppose, that some 
irregularities will occur, and that attempts will be made at retaUa- 
tion, by individuals suffering from the consequences of such wrongs 
and injuries. These acts of individuals, though in a great degree 
excusable under such peculiar circumstances, should not be imputed 
to their Grovemment. 

The undersigned would then again repeat, that his Gk)vemment 
will not, in any instance, depart from the principles, which it has 
avowed to the world — principles, which form the basis of all national 
respectabihty, and which holds together the fabric of the moral 
universe. 

It is tme, Texas may be driven, by paramount necessity, to the 
pursuance of a retaliatory war with Mexico, of the character, which 
that Government has so long pursued against her; but when she 
does so, that same necessity will be abundantly apparent, and justify 
her in the opinions of mankind.

The undersigned, believing that the foregoing facts, in relation to 
the campaign, under Brigr Gen Somervell, will sufficiently justify 
the acts of his Grovernment, and place the same in a proper light, 
avails himself of this occasion to again respectfully invite the atten- 
tion of Mr Webster, to the recent and continued outrages, committed 
by Mexico, upon the persons and lives of our citizens, who have 
been taken prisoners, in the predatory and marauding incursions 
made upon our territory, and on other occasions; which it is believed 
are of such a character as to demand, of those civilized nations, who 
have acknowledged the independence of Texas, and whose citizens 
are, in many instances, the participants of these outrages, a prompt 
and efficient interference, for the purpose of arresting them. In 
doing so, and for the purpose of exhibiting more fully the course, 
which has been pursued by both countries, since the commencement 
of hostiUties between them, the undersigned would beg the indulgence 
of Mr. Webster while he presents a brief history of their conflicts, 
together with the manner of treatment, which has been extended to 
prisoners, who have fallen into the power of either of the contending 
parties. 

The inhuman butcheries, committed upon our citizens, whom the 
fortune, of war, had placed in the power of Mexico in 1835 and '36, 
produced a feeling of horror, from which civilized humanity has too 
recently recovered to have forgotten them. The names, of Grant, 
Ward, King, Travis and Fannin, present to the recollections of all, 
who have read the details, of our early struggles for freedom, correspond- 
ing instances of inhuman and cold blooded murders, committed 
upon helpless prisoners — of violations of faith and of perfidy, on 
the part of Mexico, that are in striking contrast with the forbearance 
and humanity, which, from the commencement of the war in 1835, 
up to the present time, has characterized the course of Texas in its 
prosecution. 

In December 1835, the town and fortress, of San Antonio de Bexar, 
were beseiged by the Texian Army, under the command of Col B. R. 
Milam; and Gen Martin Perfecto de Cos, Commander in Chief of 
the Eastern Internal Provinces of Mexico, surrendered himself and 
about 1500 men prisoners of war, by articles, of capitulation, signed 
on the 10th. of that month. The conditions, of this surrender, were 
faithfully observed by Texas; and Gen Cos, with all his officers, and 
the men under his command, was permitted to return to Mexico 
upon parole — their persons and property being in every respect safe 
and inviolate. 

On the 21st of April Gen Santa Anna then President of Mexico, and 
Commander in Chief of the Army of Operations against Texas was 
met and defeated at San Jacinto. The President-Greneral and Seven 
himdred and fifty Officers and men surrendered themselves at discre-

tion and on their knees implored that mercy which they had so 
recently denied to those unfortmiate men who fell into their power 
at Groliad and the Alamo. These prisoners had forfeited every claim 
to the mercy they sought, having been engaged in waging a war of 
extermination ^and giving neither quarter to the vanquished nor 
observing the faith they had promised by solemn compact to those 
who siurrendered with Col Fannin and others; aH of whom (with the 
exception of the medical men whose services were required for their 
own wounded) were massacred by order of Gen Santa Anna. Gten 
Cos who was taken a prisoner with the rest, had doubly forfeited his 
life, having violated the parole he had given at San Antonio the 
December previous, and subsequently engaged in an unauthorized 
mode of warfare: But notwithstanding all these powerful incentives 
to a just vengeance, and the then recent distresses which the Mexican 
army had brought upon the whole country, the Uves of all these pris- 
oners were generously spared — they were supported at the expense of 
the Government — were kindly treated in every respect — the woimded 
and sick had the best medical attention and the most assiduous care, 
and all who wished it were sent home to their own country. As an 
evidence of the humanity with which they were treated, reference is 
made to the fact that many of these prisoners chose to remain in the 
country and continue in it up to the present day. 

Gren Filisola and the troops under his command fled from the coun- 
try immediately after the battle of San Jacinto in the utmost confusion 
and dismay, and although they could have been cut up by our army 
the hand of vengeance was withheld; and in strict fulfillment of the 
promise made this General with his troops was permitted to leave the 
country undisturbed. His oflBcial report to his own nation and the 
defence which he published to the world in justification of his precipi- 
tate retreat clearly prove the truth of the above statement in relation 
to him. 

The President of Mexico, Gen Santa Anna was treated with every 
possible respect and kindness and with all the forbearance consistent 
with his safe keeping as a prisoner of war: and was finally sent to the 
city of Washington agreeably to his own soUcitation, imder an escort 
of three distinguished officers and at the pubUc expense, from which 
place he returned safely to Mexico. 

The sparing the Uves of these prisoners and the indulgences ex- 
tended to them was a voluntary act on the part of Texas: and their 
final release and restoration to liberty an act of humanity and mercy. 
The obligations which these impose upon civiUzed man were the only 
ones which my Government was under towards these captive enemies; 
while justice if her stern mandates had been obeyed would have 
required their execution or at least that of their leaders.

158 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The course of Mexico towards the citizens of my Government who 
have fallen into her hands has been of a character wholly at variance 
with this conduct on our part as will be seen by the following state- 
ment of facts. 

Passing over the massacres of our citizens in 1835 and 6 which M*e 
already sufficiently known and are alluded to in a former part of this 
communication, this detail will be confined to transactions of a recent 
date. 

A party of peaceful traders and others sent out to Santa F6 in the 
latter part of 1841 consisting of about 325 men were induced to sur- 
render themselves prisoners of war to the troops under command of 
Gov Armijo. Articles of capitulation were agreed to and signed by 
the two parties, by which the Texians were promised security of per- 
sons and individual property, kind treatment and speedy restoration 
to perfect liberty. But no sooner had they laid down their arms, than 
they were indiscriminately plundered of every article of pro{>erty they 
possessed — their hats, shoes coats blankets and even their shirts taken 
from them. Their arms were tied with cords and they were fastened 
together in numbers of two or more with raw hide and some secured 
by cabristas <* to the tails of Mexican horses and mules. In this con- 
dition, in the coldest of the winter weather, exposed to every vicissi- 
tude and inclemency of the climate, suffering alternately from cold and 
hunger and hourly insulted and abused by the officers and soldiers 
in whose chM*ge they [were] placed by the Governor of Santa Fe, they 
were marched on foot a distance of 2500 miles to the city of Mexico. 
On the way those who failed from fatigue debility or sickness were 
deUberately murdered, their ears cut off and transmitted to Mexico as 
a proof of the fidelity of the commanding officer of the guard in the 
fulfillment of his inhuman orders. Those who survived the fatigues 
of this long march and arrived in Mexico (with a few exceptions) were 
confined in prisons at night and in the day were turned out, chained 
together like criminals to sweep the streets of the city. Their Uves 
however were spared and they were finaUy released. Their support 
while in Mexico was derived principally from the generous advances 
and contributions made by foreigners; and their return home was 
effected in the same maimer. 

On the 11th. of September last Gen Adrian Woll with a force of 
about Sixteen. or seventeen hundred men entered San Antonio de 
Bexar under cover of a dense fog, early in the morning and captured 
fifty four citizens of that place. Herewith I transmit a copy of the 
statement furnished to the Department of State of Texas by Col 
Andrew Neill a highly respectable gentleman of Gonzales who was 
one of the number captured by Gen Woll while attending as a lawyer 
to his duties at the circuit Court then in session and who has since 

a Uair ropes.

effected his excape and returned to Texas. His statement is entitled 
to entire credit and by its perusal Mr. Webster will be able to derive 
an accurate and complete detail of all the transactions connected with 
the treatment of the prisoners made by Gen WoU, which appears to 
have been similar to that extended to the Santa F6 prisoners except 
that their ultimate fate is yet unknown. (See A. NeUl's statement.)* 

On the 25th. of December last a force of Texians commanded by 
Col Wm S. Fisher amounting to about 250 men surrendered them- 
selves prisoners of war to Generals Ampudia and Canales of the Mex- 
ican Army at the town of Mier, under articles of capitulation, the 
terms of which are not precisely known. From the inhuman treat- 
ment heretofore inflicted upon our prisoners, it is much to be feared 
that Gen Santa Anna or those acting by his influence or orders will 
sacrifice the lives of these unfortunate men upon the pretext that 
they were not acting at the time under the orders of the Texian 
Government, or some other plea. It will be observed however that 
although the men may be all murdered who were taken prisoners 
imder Col Fisher, yet some few have escaped who can estabUsh the 
fact beyond a doubt that articles of capitulation were signed, and 
that the men were promised kind treatment and all the rights of 
prisoners of war. This being the case it cannot be material to the 
question which may be brought to an issue between them and the 
Government of Mexico whether they were acting under the immedi- 
ate and legal orders of the Government of Texas or not. They were 
prosecuting an enterprise which the Government had sanctioned — - 
that of pursuing and chastising the enemy who had just made a pred- 
atory incursion into our country and by the capitulation and 
promises made them they acquired at least the right to be considered 
and respected as prisoners of war. Had they been other than lawful 
belligerents it could not have been proper to have entered into a 
convention with them for their surrender; consequently the Govern- 
ment of Mexico is bound by every obligation of law justice and 
humanity to observe in good faith the conditions of this surrender. 
The capitulation upon expl-essed terms of agreement between them 
and their captors most certainly brought them within the scope of 
the rules of civilized war. It is also to be observed that at the time 
of the capitulation our citizens were by no means vanquished but 
might have fought their way out with much probabiUty of success 
had not the most solemn promises of kind treatment and security 
for persons and property been made them by the Mexican commanders 
Generals Ampudia and Canales. 

In ^ach of the instances now before recited the acknowledged laws 
of civilized war as well as the principles of common humanity had 
been outrageously violated by Mexico. But the capture and treat-

ment of the prisoners taken at Bexar in September last are attended 
by circumstances of great aggravation. The Mexicans entered the 
town early in the morning under the cover of a dense fog and without 
any previous notification whatever. There were no troops at this 
point at the time as was well known to Gen Woll (he having constant 
means of information from the place.) No necessity could there- 
fore have existed for a General at the head of Seventeen hundred 
men to have taken the town by surprise which only contained some 
sixty private citizens, then quietly pursuing their ordinary avoca- 
tions; the most of them being in attendance on the District Court of 
the fourth Judicial District then in session. Bexar is an extreme 
frontier town, insulated from the rest of Texas, eminently exposed 
to attack from Indians or Mexican banditti. Rumors, as usual dur- 
ing the session of the Court, had two or three days been afloat that 
some enemy, the character of whicfh was unknown were hovering 
about the place, and when ^ on the morning of the 11th. the citizens 
being aroused from their beds by the cry that the enemy were in 
town from a natural impulse rushed to their arms to defend them- 
selves, as they had every right to suppose from savages or robbers. 
So soon however as it was known to be a regular Mexican force of 
seventeen hundred men which had in this extraordinary and unusual 
manner approached the place they laid down their arms and offering 
no further resistance the town was immediately surrendered. All 
the citizens of the place were therefore entitled to be considered non- 
combattants, as they were but a moment in arms; and the time and 
manner of Gen WoU's approaching the town were such as to lead the 
inhabitants to the beUef that the object of the attack upon a small 
defenseless town like Bexar must have been plunder or assassination, 
which it was clearly their right and duty to resist. But the whole of 
them were forced to surrender as prisoners of war under articles of 
capitulation. Among those thus taken prisoners, was the venerable 
and highly distinguished jurist, the Hon Anderson Hutchinson, then 
presiding at the Court in session, the Hon Mr. Colquhoun Senator in 
Congress from Bexar, the Hon Mr. Maverick Representative for that 
county and the Hon W. E. Jones Representative from Cronzales and 
many others of our most reputable citizens,* several of whom were 
taken from their private houses, although they had offered no resist- 
ance. The capture of these men therefore and the forcing" them to 
sign articles of capitulation and acknowledging themselves prisoners 
of war when they had only followed the natural impulse of self defence, 
is a most gross and palpable violation of the plainest principles of 

a If the structure of this sentence had been more carefully noted by its writer, he would probably have 
omitted "when."

civilized war. They were not belligerents and therefore not subject 
to the penalties which attach to belligerents. 

Since the capitulation three of these individuals have been con- 
demned to death upon the charge that they had been in the Santa 
Fe expedition, viz, Mr. George Van Ness, Archibald Fitzgerald and 
Thomas Hancock; which sentence it is understood the President of 
Mexico has since commuted to ten years confinement in prison. Had 
the sentence of death been carried into execution upon these gentle- 
men it would have constituted a most foul murder; and the impris- 
onment for ten years is an act of national perfidy and inhumanity 
against which every principle of justice and mercy is directly opposed. 
Their parole was not violated by their being at Bexar when the place 
surrendered nor had they violated it by taking up arms against 
Mexico. 

Mexico may urge in excuse for her want of faith and her inhumanity 
towards those of our citizens who have been so unfortunate as to 
fall into her power that she has not recognized Texas as an independ- 
ent nation and therefore has a right to act as she pleases in the 
premises. But the civilized world cannot admit so futile a reason. 
Texas is acknowledged as an independent power by the principal 
Governments of the world and consequently to these Governments 
so far as they are concerned Texas has all the rights and is bound 
by all the responsibilities which can attach to an independent and 
sovereign people. 

The treatment which our prisoners have received in all the above 
recited instances and which they are now receiving at Perote and 
other places where they are confined is as infamous as it is imjust. 
It is opposed to the principles of religion, to the dictates of common 
humanity and to every acknowledged rule of proceeding between 
civihzed nations in a state of war. As such the Government of Texas 
views it; and she protests to those Governments who have acknowl- 
edged her independence against the course which Mexico has pursued, 
and calls upon them to interpose their power in arresting it. They 
are directly interested in preserving the principles which all nations 
claiming to be civilized have adopted for mutual observance; and 
Texas believes that it is their right as well as their duty to interpose. 
A prompt action in this matter may save the lives of more than three 
hundred brave and chivalrous men — an object certainly which will 
sufficiently recommend itself to every generous and philanthropic 
heart. 

Mexico in her whole course of conducting the war against Texas has 
abundantly evinced the disgraceful fact, that no treaty or convention 
however solemn can bind her to the observance of either justice 
humanity or mercy and she has thus denied those great principles

which hold together the fabric of the moral Universe. If therefore 
other nations in view of these circumstances and all the facts now 
before them as well as those herein contained ^ould refuse their inter- 
ference in the premises no other course will be left to Texas in the 
future prosecution of the war with Mexico, than to adopt the prin- 
ciples of retaliation and to visit upon die people of that country the 
evils and cruelties which have so long been suffered by ours. 

For the mass of human suffering and misery which would thus be 
entailed upon the imf ortunate, the defenceless and the feeble my Gov- 
ernment will then stand acquitted to itself, to the world and to 
Almjghty God. It remains to be seen whether the civilised world 
will look on with indifference and witness so d]6asUx>us a catastrophe. 

These facts and reflections are respectively submitted to His 
Excellency the Secretary of State of the United States with a firm 
reliance that that Government; guided by that enlightened wisdom 
and respect for the laws of humanity which so eminently distinguish 
itwill give to them the consideration which iheir importance demands; 
and take such action thereon as right and justice may require.

Secretary of State ofTexa^ 
Sir 

I am instructed by the State department of the United States to 
seek an early interview with the Secretary of State of Texas, and ad- 
dress to him a strong, but kind and friendly remonstrance, to abstain 
on the part of Texas from carrying on the war (should it continue) 
against Mexico by means of predatory incursions, whither with a view 
to retaliation or otherwise. But so long as the war continues, to 
carry it on openly, honorably, and according to the rules recognized 
by all civilized and Christian States in modem times. 

At the request of Mr. Van Zandt your Charge d' Affaires now at 
Washington, similar instructions have been given to the United 
States minister at Mexico. 

As I am unable to visit Washington at this time, on aocount of 
indisposition, I should be much gratified could you visit me in Gal- 
veston when we can have a full and free oral interchange of opinions 
ypon this subject, of so much consequence to the character and good 
standing of Texas. I am however so well acquainted with the opin- 
ions of the President of Texas upon this subject that I feel assured 
that there will be no difference of opinion between us. I know that 
he has uniformly opposed, all and every depredatory incursion by 
the people of Texas upon Mexico. You will please inform me by 
return mail whither you will visit me in Galveston and if so when, 
as I intend the moment my health will permit me to do so with 
safety to visit Washington. 

With renewed assurances of respect,

Dispatch No. 99. 

Legation of Texas 

Washington City 
April 19th 1843 
Hon. Anson Jones 

Secty oj State, 

Sir: Since my last dispatch nothing of importance has transpired 
in relation to our affairs here. Mr. Webster has been absent for a 
few weeks on a visit to Boston, but is daily expected home. It is 
again understood, here, that if nothing is heard from England before 
the 1st. of May, which may require his attention in the State Depart- 
ment, that he will probably retire from the Cabinet about that time. 
Who is to be his successor seems not yet to be determined, or if deter- 
mined on, is not known to the public. Messrs Upshur, Gushing, 
Tazewell, and Stevenson are all spoken of. Judge Upshur has here- 
tofore been considered as most likely to be selected. His would be 
one of the best appointments that could be made for the interests of 
Texas. He is devoted in his attachment to our country, and anxious 
to promote our cause, besides, he is a gentleman of fine talents, high 
attainments, and has the nerve, as the Venerable Sage of the hermi- 
tage would say, to ^'take the responsibility '' and act with decission. 
I have some fears that he will not receive the appointment. Gushing 
is expected here from the north in a few days, aiid is very desirous, I 
have heard, to succeed Mr. Webster, but I hope the good sense of the 
President will not suffer his partiality to lead him so far into an error, 
as this certainly would be, for, he would inevitably be again rejected 
by the Senate, and thereby increase the confusion already existing. 
Mr. Gushing is a man of decided abihties, for his age, and an avowed 
friend of Texas, but the truth is, the northern influence, which is 
opposed to us, and which would be certainly felt by him in that sta- 
tion, more or less, would prevent him from taking any efficient step 
calculated to benefit us. 

Many other changes are expected in the house, as well as the foreign 
appointments. Judge Eve is to be recalled from Texas, and Gfen 
Murphy of Ohio, who is reputed to be a man of talents, is to succeed 
him. Mr. Proffit of Indiana 'tis said goes as Minister to Brazil. 
Mr. Waterson of Tennessee Gharge d'Affaires to Venezuela, vice. 
Hall, of Nashvilte, to be recalled.

COBRESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 165 

Since I wrote you last I have had frequent interviews with the 
President in regard to the interposition of this Government; and in 
our several conversations he has xiniformly expressed a wish, and 
desire to take effective measures to put an end to the difficulties 
between us and Mexico, but I think he is fearful to make any impor- 
tant movement, except he has the unanimous approval of his advisers. 
In one of our conversations he used to me this language, ^*Sir, I wish 
you to be assured that I feel the deepest interest in the affairs of your 
country, and wish to do every thing compatible with propriety to 
aid you, and if possible to annex you to us; but you see Tiow I am 
situated' \ (alluding I took it for granted to the embarrassments of 
his admim'stration). He then remarked that when Mr. Webster 
returned he would urge upon him the early consideration of my com- 
munication last addressed to the Department. I then told the 
President that I had understood him to say that Mr. Webster had 
been directed to approach the French Minister upon the subject of a 
United and joint interposition by France and the United States: he 
repUed that it was true, but that Mr. Webster had been so much 
engaged with English affairs that he had failed to do so, and that, 
moreover, Mr. Webster had not acted with that promptness, which he 
the President had desired, but that he would promise me that he 
would call Mr. Webster's attention to it again, so soon as he retiuned, 
and that I should be advised at an early day of their determination. 
I told the President that I was fully sensible of his kind feelings for 
Texas, and that I had not failed to make the same known in my dis- 
patches to my Government, and that I was satisfied they would be 
properly appreciated; and that I hoped that no unnecessary delay 
would be had in coming to a determination upon the matters alluded 
to in my communication — that the laws of nations clearly justified, 
and the rights and interests of humanity demanded their interference. 
I told him also that I was convinced that the French Grovemment 
would accede to the proposition, if made by the United States, but 
that France would feel a delicacy in making the move first, lest the 
United States might suppose she was disposed to meddle in the affairs 
of this continent, beyond what was proper. I fear that nothing 
will be done by this Government until there is a change in the office 
of Secretary of State. Mr. Webster, though the President may urge 
him up, will stiU take his own time, and do matters in his own way, 
and* while he professes the greatest friendship for Texas and I think 
is really sincere in his professions, yet his temperament is not, of 
that kind, suited to bold and decisive movements in matters, in 
which his Government is not individually concerned, or interested 
as a party, or in other Words I fear his sympathies have been tem- 
pered by a latitude too high for this emergency. A short time will 
prove the truth, or falsity of these suppositions, and ** bring to light

the things that are hidden''; *till then nothing is certain, except 
that all is uncertain. 

The pftinful intelhgence, of the recapture of our countrymen taken 
prisoners at Afier, has been confirmed, and that orders had been 
giyen to have them shot, but that throi^ the interference of the 
United States' and British Ministers the order was changed to a 
decimation, which it was hoped woidd be revoked. I await with 
great anxiety to hear the result. 

Intelligence has also reached here that Hon. W. E. Jones and 
Maverick had been released, and that Judge Hutchinson would 
likewise soon be liberated. I trust this may be true. 

The propositions of Santa Anna for peace ** have been published 
here, and various opinions expressed, how they ought to be received, 
or whether they will be considered by the Grovernment of Texas. 

Col Daingerfield has not yet embarked for Europe, having been 
detained by the severe indisposition of his mother and other causes. 
He seenots very anxious to enter upo> his mission, and wrote me 
yesterday that he thought he should be off soon. Your communi- 
cations to him addressed to my care were duly received and very 
satisfactory to the Colonel. I am looking for him here to day, when 
we doall visit the President, and some of the Diplomatic gentlemen. 

The Chevalier Gevers, the Dutch Charge d'Affairs, left here for 
New York a short time ago. He was very desirous to know if his 
Government had an agent of any character in Texas* I told him I 
tiiou^t not, but that I would ascertain and inform him. Knowing 
that Col Daingerfield would be here I concluded to reserve the 
inquiry for him, and he has informed me that he is of opinion tiiere 
is none, and I shall so inform the Chevalier. This gentleman and 
myself are on the most intimate terms — ^he seems to feel much inters 
est in the affairs of Texas, and says that such is the disposition of 
his Government towards us. He is also very intimate with Gen 
Almonte, and from him, when here, I coxild generally learn Almonte's 
vicws» 

The Prussian Minister, Baron Roenne, returned to Europe by the 
last packet. I think he left here very favorably impressed towards 
Texas, and her growing importance as a market for European manu- 
factures and products. The gentleman made me several personal 
visits which were duly returned — he also made many inquiries about 
Texas, which I took great pains to answer, and at the same time 
infonning him what articles of Prussian Manufacture would likely 
he reqniired in our markets. 

I have obtained the blanks from the Genl. Post OflBce which you 
desired me to send you, but I shall not forward them imtil I can 
have an opportunity of a private conveyance to New Orleans. The

package will be very large, and the postage would come to more than 
would be gamed by sending them right away — they probably contain 
more than a himdred different forms. 

I have also obtained a full copy of the census documents of the 
United States, including a statistical account of the commerce, man- 
ufactures, and products of each state, and much other information — 
they comprise four large volumes, one of which is two feet by eighteen 
inches and contains between four and five himdred pages. I will 
send them to you whenever an opportunity offers — they will prove 
a valuable acquisition to the library of your Department. 

I have concluded upon reflection that much good might result from 
a proper, and fair publication of facts in this coimtry, in relation to 
Texas, with a view to correct eroneous impressions existing here 
prejudicial to our interests, and to show the important advantages 
to be derived from annexation, and particularly the great benefits 
which the northern states would secure by such a treaty. I feel 
satisfied that it is not in keeping with the genius of the northern 
people to sacrifice their interest to their sympathy, &nd if they can 
be induced to believe that their pecuniary interest would be pro- 
moted by such a st^^ they would at once leap the barriers erected 
by the fanaticism of abolitionists, and become the advocates of the 
measure. I believe that this is a subject in which the northern peo- 
ple should feel as much interested, and more so, if possible, than the 
south. Many of the facts necessary to be stated, and the arguments 
used will apply with equal force to the pending treaty. I have been 
for sometime collecting facts in relation to this subject. My design 
is to publish, under an anonymous signature, the communications 
in some newspaper of general circulation, and in time to appear before 
the sitting of the next Congress. I shall first continue to collect all 
the facts in my power, before the first number is written. If you 
can send me the printed reports of the Secretary of the Treasury for 
1841 and 1842 I shall be very glad, as from them I can probably 
learn something of our exports and imports, which I cannot obtain 
elsewhere. 

You will perhaps think this dispatch contains some things not 
likely to benefit you much, but I think it best to give you matters in 
detail as much as possible, especially, conversations with the Presi- 
dent and Secretary of State, from which you will be enabled to form 
your own conclusions, if they should differ from mine. In addition 
to this I am gratified to believe, that should I state any thing which 
is unnecessary, your better judgment will enable you to winnow the 
wheat from the chaff. 

With the hi^est sentiments of regard I have the honor to remain

Dispatch! Legation of Texas 

No.lOO.j Washington City 

April gist, 184S 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secty oj StcUe 

Sir: I have just returned from a visit to the State Department, 
where I had an interview with Mr. Secretary Webster. I now sub- 
mit you the substance of conversation between us. Ml*. Webster 
inquired whether I knew what answer was, or would be given to the 
propositions of Santa Anna. I replied I did not, but was of opinion 
they would not be entertained for a moment. Or if entertained at 
all, it would be merely for the purpose of submitting a counter propo- 
sition for peace, upon terms of the acknowledgment of our inde- 
pendence. Mr. Webster then remarked, that, if we intended to 
maintain our nationality, we should at once reject such a proposition. 
He then asked me various questions in relation to my views and 
opinions of the probable result of the campaign and cruise against 
Yucatan; In answering which I, endeavored to impress him with the 
opinion that the Mexican fleet and forces would be compelled to retire, 
without accomplishing any important result. This is a matter which 
has been frequently discussed between Mr. Webster and myself; he 
has alwajs expressed the opinion that the favorable or unfavorable 
termination of that Campaign would determine the ability or ina- 
biUty of Mexico to re-invade Texas. 

At this stage of the conversation, I introduced the subject of my 
last communication to his Department in relation to our affairs with 
Mexico. I asked him if he had taken time to consider that communi- 
cation; he replied he had; I then asked him if he had formed any 
conclusion upon the matters and things embraced in it. His reply 
was in about these words, "Sir; your affairs assume so many different 
pJiases that it is impossible one day to tell what will be the appear- 
ance on the next. If your Government would take the advice of its 
friends, to remain at home, unite among yourselves, confine yoUr

soldiers to your own territory, and to the defence of your own soil, 
suppress insubordination, prevent marauding parties upon the 
frontier and consolidate your energies, then Sir, we might be able to 
do something effective/' I replied to this that such was the avowed 
policy of the administration at the head of affairs of my Grovemment, 
and to which it was disposed to adhere, and this I thought must be 
sufficiently demonstrated in my communication addressed to him. 
Mr. Webster replied, ''that Sir, perhaps is true, so far as the officers of 
Government are concerned, but what avails the disposition of Officers, 
who cannot execute their purposes, or what is a Government which 
cannot enforce its orders; it is the business of Government to 
govern its citizens, and, when it ceases to be able to do that, it argues 
that there is not much Government in force". 

I said in reply, to this, that I was of opinion from all I could learn 
from home, that there was an evident change in public feeling in this 
respect; that every thing seemed quiet. Any dissensions that might 
have existed, I thought had, or would soon disappear, and in future 
I hoped we should be united; that these were but momentary, and 
could not be of long duration. He then continued thus, ''So soon as 
we ascertain what disposition your Government shall make of Santa 
Anna's proposition, we shall then determine what course we will 
take, but, during the pendency of these questions, or a negotiation 
between Texas and Mexico, we should feel ourselves awkwardly situ- 
ated to attempt an interference. If those propositions are at once 
disposed of, and you continue to persevere in your avowed poUcy, we 
shall think it proper to make a communication to Mexico on the sub- 
ject, and say to her, Site must terminate the vxir ai once eitJier hy treaty 
or hy arms; and address a copy of the same to France and England." 

Tliese are the most important items of our conversation during the 
interview. They at once suspend matters here, until I hear from 
your department. Should I obtain the desired intelligence, Mr. Web- 
ster may take the step pointed out; but it is impossible to speak with 
certainty upon the subject. I have so often thought I was on the 
eve of accomplishing it when something would immediately inter- 
vene to prevent it, that I will not permit myself to calculate posi- 
tively on any event which is yet in the womb of futurity. The next 
news from Texas may present some new pTiasey in that case, all the 
ground is to be gone over again. 

You will learn from this conversation something of the state of 
feeling here in relation to our affairs. Mr. Webster in his remarks, 
but reiterates the general sentiment. 

I look with much anxiety to hear the course of om* people. Situ- 
ated as I am at such a distance, it is impossible for me always to know 
the true state of things at home, and to judge of the truth or false- 
hood of all I hear. If it be true, that there are some few individuals.

17th March 1843 
Sir 

I find that many vessels sailing under the American flag and having 
American papers have applied to the Collectors of the Customs in the 
several ports in the Republic of Texas, for coasting license and have 
received them. 

The masters of vessels should invariably make a deposite of his 
Register with the American Consul, and receive a certificate from him 
that such surrender has been made. Then and not till then should 
coasting license be granted to any American vessel by this Govern- 
ment. 

This rule which to me would seem right, has not been adhered to. 
I have found masters of American vessels in possession of two sets of 
papers, and as they preferred to retain their coasting license, I have 
deprived them of the Register. 

Finding American vessels with two sets of papers a coasting license 
and Register induced me to enquire how many and what vessels had 
applied for and obtained license to carry on the coasting trade, and 
the 10th. of February I addressed a letter to the collector of the Cus- 
toms for the port of Velasco, and requested him to send me the Reg- 
ister of an American vessel which the Captain said he had deposited 
with the collector at Velasco, and requested also the collector at 
Velasco to advise me of the names of the American vessels he had 
granted license to in order To carry on the coastiiig trade. I received 
for answer, a note under date the 10th. Inst, a copy of which I here- 
with enclose.

. You will see at once how improper it is to grant coasting license to 
American vessels; without keeping the American Consul advised of 
the fact, and as I have before said whilst the vessel is in possession of 
her register. 

The American Consul is the proper person to have in possession the 
Registers of all vessels sailing under the American flag and not the 
collector. 

If I thought proper I could appoint an agent at Velasco, and cer- 
tainly if I have the right or authority to appoint an agent to receive 
the papers of American vessels I have the right to demand them of 
the collector.

Should the contemplated change take place m the State Department 
anfl a new Secretary of State of the U States be appomted it would 
probably be well for you to remain at your post untill such time as 
you could, have a full understanding with him concerning the affairs 
of Texas. During the months of July and August, the officers of 
Govt, of the United States are generally absent, from Washington, 
and but little public business can be transacted there. If you could 
embrace this period conveniently for your visit home, there could 
be no objection to your doing so, and remaining untill those officers 
returned, and the pubUc business should be resumed. 

I enclose you herewith, a copy of the translation of a document, 
furnished to James W. Robinson (one of the Bexar prisoners) by 
the President of Mexico Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. This 
embraces the propositions which Mr. Robinson was authorized by 
that functionary on behalf of the Mexican Government to make to 
the people of Texas, and instructions in relation to the same^ 

No propositions of any character have been submitted by Mexico 
to this Government, nor was Mr. Robinson charged with any com- 
munication to it. 

The propositions of Gen. Santa Anna, have been published by 
Mr. Robinson through the medium of the public papers, and have 
every where been met by the people to whom they were addressed 
with indignation and contempt, and rejected by one unanimous 
response from the whole country. You will at once perceive the 
absurd attitude in which Gen Santa Anna has placed himself by 
this injudicious and ridiculous attempt to create dissention and divi- 
sion among the people of Texas, or his ignorance of their character 
intelligence views and feelings in entertaining the expectation that 
they would accede to the proposed terms. 

Mexico must restore us our murdered thousands before we can 
ever entertain the proposition of being re-incorporated with that 
Government. 

I have the honor to be 

with the greatest respect

Elnelosed herewith I send you a copy of a commuzdcation receired 
at this Department from Doct. Joseph W. Robinson a citizen of 
Travis County, relative to the negro boys captured by hostile Indians 
in 1840. 

Dr. Robinson also states that a correspondence has been had by a 
former representative of thb Oovemment and the Grovemment of the 
United States on this subject, but as the Archives of this Department 
are still detained by the citizens of Austin* I am unable to, know the 
nature of that corres{>ondence or the present situation of the business. 
If such a correspondence has been had it will be found on the files of 
the Legation at Washington, which you will please refer to, and take 
such steps in the matter as will bring the same to a conclusion, and 
that Dr. R. may either have his negroes restored to him (if the cir- 
cumstances should be foimd as stated,) or be compensated for their 
capture, and loss 

I have the honor to be

Dear Sir In February 1839 a desc[e]nt was made by a party of 
Indians upon my plantation on the Colerado River and among other 
thing[s] carried off two negro boys one of them about thirteen or 
fourteen years old named Manuel the other nine or ten named Aaron 
and in the fall of 1840 1 was told by a Delaware Indian of the name of 
Frank who is well known from the circumstance of his having a red 

aMajrS^l^^ SMCalBBdac of COTiMpOBdMMB with the United States In Ptft I. 

ft Soon after the capture of San Antonio by Vasquez^ March 5, 1842, President Houston moved with his 
cabinet to the city of Houston, and made that the headquarters of the government for the next three 
years. The people of Austfai, however, would not surrender the archives. An abortive eflori to carry 
tl^ away by force resulted In what Is known as the "Archive War." See Bancroft, North Mexican

head thai said boys were in the possession of a Mr Edwards a white 
man who lived in the Cheroke nation on the Canadian River and had 
a Creek Indian for a wife, upon the receipt of the above information 
I went directly to where Edwards was living and found the boys one 
of them at Edwards and the other at Chisholms who is a Cherokee 
and the soninlaw of Edwards neither Edwards or Chisholm were mt 
home at the time and I was deterred from letting my business be 
known from the circumstance of having been cautioned particularly 
to not let it be known that I was a Texian and there was at that time 
a party of the Cherokees that had been Driven from Texas encampd 
in one mile of Edwards and directly on the road that I had to travel. 
When I arivd at home I made known to the Hon Secretary of State 
the whole matter as it then stood and he informed me afterwards 
that there had been a demand made of the U. S. A. Govt, for the 
negroes. Since that time I have not heard any thing of the matter 
except that the negroes are still in Edwards possession. Sir you will 
please to give me such information as may at any time come to your 
knowledge so that I can take such steps as is necessary on my part 
to recover the property

The Undersigned Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas having 
laid before his Excellency the President the communication from Mr. 
Joseph Eve Charg6 d' Affaires of the United States, of the 13th 
Ultimo requesting on the part of the United States that Texas will 
abstain from carrying on the war against Mexico (Should it continue) 
by predatory incursions whether with a view to retaliation or other- 
wise, has now the honor by the instructions of the President to assure 
Mr. Eve that no orders have been or will be issued by him authorizing 
any predatory incursions into the territory, of Mexico and that Texas 
will continue to abstain from any such mode of warfare, and that in 
the further prosecution of the contest she will carry it on, according 
to the rules recognized by all civilized nations in modem times; 
imless provoked to a contrary course by a continuance of unwarrant- 
able acts of aggression, inhumanity robbery and perfidy and murder 
on the part of Mexico herself. 

In the personal interviews with Mr. Eve which the undersigned 
had the honor of holding at Galveston recently in relation to this 
subject, this assurance was given Mr Eve verbally; and the Under- 
signed is happy in stating to Mr Eve that the President has been 
much gratified in rec[e]iving the information then given the Under- 
signed that his Excellency's condutit and policy in the prosecution 
of the contest with Mexico and in the mode of warfare adopted by

The Attitude towards Texas and Mexico now assumed by the Gov- 
ernment ol the United States as the leading power upon the continent 
of America, and the Conservator of those high principles of civiliza- 
tion and humanity regulating the mode of modem warfare, as 
acknowledged by all Christian States in the pres^it age, being in 
accordance with the declared views and wishes of this government, 
the Undersigned is further instructed to assure Mr. Eve that the 
President of Texas will endeavor by every means in his power to 
promote and render effectual the great end and ob^ct which the 
United States propose to themselves in taking this attitude

The undersigned. Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas, has 
the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the note addressed to him 
by Mr. Eve, on the 28th. ult. in relation to the subject of coasting 
licences. 

Although the adoption of the suggestion of Mr. Eve, in regard to 
this matter, might, perhaps, be productive of much general con- 
venience and benefit, the undersigned nevertheless conceives that 
the instruction to the receivers of customs, asked for, can not be 
given, as it would not be in accordance with the provisions of the 
fifth section of an act of the Congress, entitled "An Act for the regu- 
lation of the Coasting Trade and the protection of Texian Shipping", 
approved January 4th. 1841.**

[The communication from the district attorney inclosed with the 
original Department of State letter to Van Zandt is as follows:] ** 

Clarksville, Texas, May 1st, I84S. 
To Hon. Anson Jones, 

Secretary of State. 
Sir, 

The enclosed Petition will give all the information in my possession 
concerning the seizure of certain Goods etc. imported to,* and stored 
within the limits of this Republic. 

It becomes my duty to report to your Department the manner in 
which said Goods, were taken from the possession of James Bourland, 
the Collector of Customs for this District. Captn. Joseph Scott, the 
master of the Steamer Fort Towson mentioned in the petition, after 
learning of the seizure, and before the issuing of the monition by the 
Clerk as required by law, proceeded to the landing at which said goods 
were stored, and then in possession of the Collector, and together with 
the crew of his own vessel, and that of the Steamer Hunter, consist- 
ing of about thirty men in all, after seizing the Collector, forcibly took 
the goods out of his possession, and reshipping them on board of his 
vessel, immediately conveyed them off. This flagrant violation of 
the requirements of good neighborhood, and infraction of our rights 
as a nation, by a citizen of another Government, (the United States) 
was accompanied by the grossest indignities to the person of the Col- 
lector Mr. Bourland, who was seized by this lawless band of ruflBans 
and intruders, forcibly thrown down, and tied hand and foot, and 
compelled to remain in that degrading situation, until they completed 
their robbery. 

I have conceived it my duty to furnish you with this statement of 
the facts, to enable you to take such steps as may be necessary to 
obtain redress for this; and prevent the recurrence of similar out- 
rages; by teaching the aggressors what fearful risks they run, by an 
interference with the rights of nations. Something should be done 
by our Government, to remedy the frequent violations of the rights 
of both our Citizens, and Government. The citizens, and I am sorry 
to add, too frequently the Officers of the United States, forgetful of 
the principles of justice, and all regard for treaty stipulations, trample 
upon those rights, reckless of the consequences that may ensue from 
embroiling the two Countries; careful alone of their own personal 
safety, and arrogantly insulting, from the hope, that they will be 
shielded by their own Government. 

In October last, a Col. Loomis, the Commandant of the garrison 
at Fort Towson, without justification or provocation, ordered the 

a See Records of Department of State (Texas), Book 45, p. 84.

destruction of a number of Barrells of Whiskey, the property of Capt. 
Travis G. Wright, (a highly respectable and worthy citizen of tiiis 
RepubUc). The Whiskey was on board a keel boat, upon which it 
had been freighted, and which said boat was discharging freight for 
the Garrison, at Fort Towson, previous to proceeding to Captain 
Wrights landing, which order was executed. The proofs, I am happy 
to learn are being prepared to be sent to your Department. 

Whilst every exertion is being used to enforce the treaty stipula- 
tions governing the intercourse of the two countries, by the authori- 
ties of this, I can hear of none being made to check their infraction on 
the part of the United States, or any notice taken of the conduct of 
offenders; If that Government were notified of this state of affairs, 
they would certainly remedy it. 
I have the honor to be, 

Your Obedient Servt.

Minister of Texas 

at Washington etc etc 

The memorial of Joseph Cooper of the City of New York, Gun 
Maker 

Respectfully showeth That in the year one thousand eight hundred 
and thirty six, your memorialist Joseph Cooper was applied to by 
General Memucan Hunt to furnish fire arms, swords and ammunition 
to be used by the Texian Army, and trusting in the honor and state- 
ments of the said Genl. Memucan Hunt your memorialist was induced 
to agree to furnish the same and General Hunt handed your memo- 
rialist several promissory notes — the payment whereof were also 
guaranteed in ¥rriting by the Honorable J Pinckney Henderson, his 
guarantee being in the following words: 

*'Know all men by these presents that whereas one hundred and 
sixty promissory notes are this day made by Major General Memucan 
Himt of the Texian army of five himdred and eighty dollars each, 
payable at the Bank of America in the City of New York to the 
order of H. S. Foote, due two years after date, Now I J. Pinckney 
Henderson being jointly interested with said Hunt in raising of the 
money designed to be raised upon said notes for the benefit of the 
cause of Texas, do hereby in consideration of the same, guarantee the 
faithful payment of the same, assuming aU responsibility in relation 
to the liquidation of said notes anterior to aU the endorsers who 
may successively endorse the same: and do hereby absolutely pledge 
my estate both real and personal in behalf of said liquidation, so 
as to secure the punctual payment of all of said notes, and thereby 
entirely liberate all endorsers whatever from all responsibility and 
shield them effectually against all pecuniary detriment, each of 
which promissory notes are of the same tenor and date, and amount 
in the aggregate to the sum — ^ninety two thousand dollars. 

Witness my hand this twenty ninth day of September, in the year 
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty six.

And your memorialist shows that he furnished to General Himt 
as far as it was possible at the time snch fire arms, swords and ammu- 
nition as follows: 

H. 1.3. 3 casee containing 

50 United Statee Carbines a |25 $1250.

6.10. 5 cases muskets containing 

100 United States muskets and bayonets (ft $6 eOO. 

5 casiB and cartage 7 



$2234. 



And your memorialist shows that though he holds nineteen of the 
one himdred and sixty promissory notes mentioned in the guarantee 
of J Pinckney Henderson, yet be has no right over the same, except 
to the extent of the above balance of Two thousand and two hundred 
and thirty four dollars, and he is willing to give up all the notes if he 
can be paid what is justly due to him. 

Your memorialist was obliged on account of General Himt not pay- 
ing the account or any of the notes to sue General Hunt in New 
Orleans, whose bail, however, took advantage of an act then lately 
passed ; and your memorialist instead of securing any part of his debt 
has to pay his lawyers a large amount for fees. 

Although he has made urgent request of General Htmt to pay or 
cause the said amoimt due to him to be paid, and though application 
has been made to the surety General Henderson, yet the debt has 
been in no way paid, although your memorialist has been greatly 
distressed for the want of money ; that he is now over sixty jrears of 
age; and will not be able to pay his honest debts unless the above 
account be paid to him. 

And your memorialist shows that inasmuch as the said fire arms, 
swords and ammunition were ordered for and used by the Texan 
Government, therefore it is respectfully urged and asked that the 
Texas Government should through your Excellency, cause or take 
such measures that the said account may be paid. 

Your Memorialist prays accordingly that your Excellency will take 
such measures as will secure to your memorialist and his family the 
said amount of Two thousand Two himdred and thirty four Dollars.

«k>N£8 TO Van Zandt.* 

Department of State 
Washington [TVa^cw], June 8th, 1843. 
Hon. I. Van Zandt 

Charge d^ Affaires 
Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Raymond's 
letter to this Department, under date of the 12th Ulto. with the 
accompanying documents, in relation to certain acts of Col. Warfield. 

Enclosed I send you a copy of the instructions given to Col^ War- 
field by the Secretary of War and Marine in August last,^ siiskce which 
time the Ck>vemment Qi Texas, has hftd no communication with tJ^at 
GentlMnan. Indeed \mtill very recently it had supposed that Um 
proposed expedition of Col. Warfield had beeA long since abaadooed. 
When ho received his eommissioQ and these instructioiui, the Grovem* 
ment was led to believe that he would act immediat^y, and the 
object of giving him his powers was to make a diversion through Ms 
agency, so as to favor the expeditiooi which [it} wae anticipated would 
cross the Rio Grande in the fall, and after ooeupying Santa F4 (which 
is in our declared limits) to fall down and form a junfitioik with the 
leader of that expedition. From his not having acted at the con- 
templated period, therefore, the presumptioa was that he had 
abandoned his expedition. 

Yon will pereieve that the instructions to Col. Warfield in no respect 
autiiorize his enlisting men and oi'gmuing an expedition within the 
limits of the United States, and thi» government disclaims giving 
its sancticm to any act ol Col. Warfield, which should violate the 
rights or hazard the neutral obUgatkms of the United Stsjte». 

The enclosed letteor from the Department of War and Marine you 
will forward to Mr. Warfield whenever you can ascertain his locality. 
Upon his receipt of the same it will opiate as a notification to him 
that all powers heretofore granted him by this Goverameat hav^ been 
revoked.* 

On receipt of this dispatdn^ you will address the Department of 
State of the United States, grnng the explanations authorized above 
and communicating tiia fact tbiat the letter revoking tha powero 
granted to Mr. Warfldd has been sect him. 
I have the honeor to be *

Galveston 
June 10th. I84S 
Mr. President, 

I am instructed by the Secretary of State of the United States, in 
taking leave of your Government to avail myself of the occasion, to 
express to you assurances of the continued good will of the President 
of the United States towards the Republic of Texas — ^And his desire 
to preserve and improve the relations of harmony, so happily sub- 
sisting between the two countries, which I pray God may continue to 
exist. Were I to stop here Mr. President without expressing my 
gratitude for your kindness, and that of the people of Texas to me, 
I should do injustice to my own feelings. The courtious, and uncere- 
monious manner with which you, and each member of your Cabinet 
have received me in public, as well as our private intercourse, calls 
from me most sincerely the expression of my thanks. And whereever 
my future destiny may place me, the Government and people of 
Texas, will have my warmest wishes, for the success of their just 
cause, their prosperity, and happiness. I will further say Sir that I 
trust, and hope the day is not distant, if Mexico shall not yield to 
the remonstances of friendly foreign powers, and acknowledge the 
independence of Texas, that my Government being the oldest on this 
continent, will pursue the example of the leading European powers 
on that continent, and say to Mexico, the war you are waging is 
hopeless, you are conducting it in an nnchristian manner, and not 
according to the usages of international law, with Christian people, 
that it is an useless waste of human life, and is daily producing indi- 
vidual suffering, that it interrupts and harrasses the commercial 
relations of every coimtry, and more especially that of the U. States. 
Therefore you must cease your hostile operations. 

It is now more than seven years since the declaration of your inde- 
pendence, which I consider to have teen perfected on the glorious 
and memorable field of San Jacinto, where you sir in the van of your 
gallant comrades, acquired a fame that time cannot take from you. 
The mercy and humanity displayed on that occasion to a foe that had 
never shown either, adds a glorioxis lustre to the victory of that day.

the blood of your countrymen, who had perfidously violated the terms 
of capitulation entered into by the lamented Fannin, who in viola- 
tion of the laws of justice, humanity, and of Gpd, caused him and 
his gallant companions to be slain in cold blood. He had justly for- 
feited his life, yet History will record that you spared this monster 
of blood, when in your power, and that this great victory, was not 
stained by a single act of violence or of bloodshed. This act alone 
should entitle you to the admiration of posterity. 

You have Mr. President a beautiful and most desirable country, 
your climate is fine, the soil equal to any, and rewards the husband- 
man with a boimtious plenty, your vast prairies with its perpetual 
verdure affords inexhaustable grazing for the herdsman. You have 
fine navigable streams. With all these advantages a few years peace, 
with a wise, economical and energetic administration of the affairs 
and the laws of the country, will make Texas, '^rich, happy, and 
Free'' 

Altho, Texas has for some time labored imder every disadvantage, 
produced from causes beyond her control, in a great degree, her 
population has steadily increased and will continue to increase, your 
agricultural wealth has been developed, in a ratio not surpassed by 
any country. Whilst Mexico in the oppression of her people, disre- 
gard of law, and order and internal convulsion, has shown her unfit- 
ness, to render happy and secure any people. The inteUigence of 
your people, and the great natural advantages of the country, does 
not leave a doubt that Texas is destined to take a proud rank amidst 
the Republics of America, unless her onward course be retarded by 
folly, and unwise Government. The race from which we have 
descended, forbid the idea, that the cause of civilization, and free 
government will fail in their hands 

Mr. President you have been a second time called by the suffrage 
of a large majority of your fellow citizens to preside over the destinies 
of this young and rising Republic. And altho you have been sur- 
rounded by difficulties seldom met, in the administration of affairs, 
I doubt not you will close your administration in a maimer most 
satisfactory, to your countrymen, and .those who feel an interest in 
Texas abroad, and that you will add to a fame so hardly won. You 
have my prayers for your success in behalf of your Country, as well 
as individually 

I have the honor to be with great consideration 
Sir 

Your obedient Servant

Since my communication to you of the 10th. Inst., infonnation has 
been received from Mexico, through H. B. M. Charg* d'AflFaires near

with the Presidents Proclamation of an Armistice are herewith

CORBBSPONDENCB WITH THE UNITED STATES^ 193 

of the same which relates to negroes of Mr Bobinson alledged to have 
been carried off by the Indians of the United States I find the follow- 
ing to be the situation as appears from the records of this legation. 
Mr Amory in the absence of Mr Bee on the 19th of May 1841 
addressed Mr Webster a communication on the subject submiting 
Mr Bobertsons statement (which I suppose similar to the one now 
made) and requesting the restoration of the two negro slaves to their 
owner the punishment of the offenders and remuneration for all other 
injuries to Mr Bobertson and his property. On the 7th October same 
year Fletcher Webster Acting Secretary of State replied by stating 
that the matter had been refered to the War Department, that the 
Secretary of War had considered and reported upon the same, a copy 
of whose report was submited to Mr Amory. The Secretary of 
War in his report says that there is no evidence whatever submited 
that the Indians who commited the depredations were from the 
United States and argues that the probability is they were Indians 
belonging to Texas He states that the SSrd Article of the treaty 
does not require the restoration of property and only contemplates 
the prevention of hostilities and return of captives. That the United 
States could only use persuasive measures with the Indians to procure 
a restoration of property and if they failed Mr Bobertsons remedy 
would be indemnification by the Grovt to be settled by negotiation 
He further states that ["]in regard to the two negroes if it be found 
that they are the property of Mr. Bobertson and that they were 
brought from Texas by United States Indians considering them as 
captives the 33rd Article of the treaty with Mexico would require 
them to be restored'' He then goes on to state the act of April 20th 
1818 « which makes it penal to bring hold or sell a slave from any 
other country etc and closes by saying that ''under the provisions of 
this act if the negroes belong to Mr Bobertson whether they were 
captured by our Indians or not imless they are fugitives they would 
have to be given up and those who brought them into the country and 
now hold them would be liable to be prosecuted and to the penalty 
of this act" 

Mr Amory replied on the llth** of October 1841 say[ing] that "as 
the Govt of the United States still keeps the question of proof of the 
wrong refered to open and upon that account declines admiting 
to their full extent the justice of the complaint of Ifidian aggressions 
that he will advise his Government of the position in which the matter 
now stands so that the most irrefragible evidence may be furnished 
etc" 

On the 12th of the same last mentioned month and year Mr Amory 
laid the whole subject before the Govt of Texas with the suggestion 

a UidUd 8taU9 StahUea at Large, HI, 451-453.

that all the evidence possible should be procured in relation to this 
and^other Indian aggressions and laid before the United States 
Charge in Texas or communicated to this I^ation Since that time 
the matter has rested so far as any thing appears among the papers 
or upon the records of this Legation. 

The United States appear to be willing to consider them as captives 
or as slaves brought into the coimtry in violation of law. Mr Amory 
seems to have sent the original statement of Mr Robinson and all 
the other evidence if there was any to the Secretary of State of the 
United States. From these facts I think it best that the matter 
should be referred to Mr Robinson that he may obtain all the proof 
possible before the subject is brought up again Entertaining this 
view I shall let the matter rest here imtill I shall hear again from 
your Department in relation to the same, when I shall without delay 
proceed in accordance with your instructions should you submit 
them for my guidance 

I enclose you a copy of a communication reed from Mr Legare 
Acting Secretary of State in reply to my note of the 3d of February 
last in relation to the conduct of A M M Upshaw Indian Agent and 
the accompanying dociunents enclosed by Mr Legare I thought it 
only necessary to acknowledge their receipt and advise Mr Legare 
that the same was transmitted to my Government for its information. 

The complaint against the whiskey shops upon the line on the 
Texian side has been frequently made to the War Department here 
as I have been told by the Secretary of War. If our Government 
has the power to prevent the sale of whiskey to the Indians along 
the line I have no doubt its exercise in suppressing the traffic would 
be attended with the most salutary effects 

I start this day for Washington with my family I go by private 
conveyance. In granting me leave of absence you suggest the 
months of August and September but say I must leave at such time 
as will be least detrimental to the public service. I have been gov- 
erned by the last suggestion The President and most of his Cabinet 
being now absent from the seat of Government I deemed it best to 
avail myself of the occasion to visit my family during their absence. 
I hope to be able to reach there by their retiurn.

Department op State 
WasUngton [Texas] July 6th 184S 
Hon. Isaac Van Zandt 

Chargi d' Affaires of Texas etc 
Sm, 

In a communication from this department addressed you on the 
10th day of February last you were instructed to give to the Secre- 
tary of State of the United States certain verbal assurances in rela- 
tion to the subject of the annexation of Texas to that government, 
and authorized on the happening of certain contingences to enter 
into some preliminary negotiations in relation to this subject, etc. 

The United States having taken no definite action in this matter, 
and there now being an increased prospect of an adjustment of our 
difficulties with Mexico, the President deems it adviseable to take 
no further action at present in reference to annexation, but has 
decided to await the issue of events now in progress, and to postpone 
that subject for future consideration and for such action as circiun- 
stances may (hereafter) render most expedient for the interests of 
this coimtry. 

It is believed that the settlement of our difficulties with Mexico 
and the acknowledgement of our independence by that power will 
very much simplify the question of the annexation of Texas to the 
United States, and if after this event Texas should continue to desire 
this annexation, a treaty for the purpose would be more likely to 
succeed and to meet with favor from the people of the United States, 
than if, as now, that question were embarrassed with a question and 
involved the contingency of a war between that Grovemment and 
Mexico. 

It being therefore the policy of this government to occupy itself 
for the present exclusively with the subject of an adjustment of the 
existing difficulties with Mexico, the instructions given you on the 
tenth day of February last above referred to are hereby suspended 
imtill further notice shall have been transmitted you from this 
department. 

In your personal intercoiu^e with the Secretary of State of the 
United States it may be proper that you should communicate this 
fact to him verbally 

I have the honor to be 

with the highest respect

A copy of Mr. Legare's note in reference to the acts of Col. Warfield 
was previously forwarded to this Department by Mr. Raymond and 
instructions on that subject were sent you on the 8th. Ulto. 

In relation to the petition of Mr. Cooper Gun Maker of New York 
for payment of a claim of $2234, for arms etc furnished to Gen. 
Memucan Hunt in the year 1836, I have consulted that gentleman 
who is now at the seat of government, and he informs me that the 
transaction between himself and Mr. Cooper was a private one 
entirely, and that the responsibility of the government of Texas was 
in no way involved in the same, which was the understanding between 
himself and Mr. Cooper at the time. As the expedition for which 
these arms etc. was furnished did not go into eflFect, it is believed that 
the Government of Texas received no benefit or advantage from the 
same and consequently there can be no obligation on its part to assume 
the debt.

Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary ofStaie 
Sm 

In your despatch of the 22nd. of May last,* I was requested to 
procure for the use of your Department the diflFerent forms used in 
the patent office of the United States, and also the laws in relation 
to patents; and to forward them by the first safe opportunity to 
the care of Wm. Bryan, Texas Consul, New Orleans. Since the 
receipt of that despatch no opportunity has offered itself, by which 
I could -send the papers desired. So soon as I can do so, I will send 
you, not only those of the patent office, but also of the Post Office, 
and the census documents, which I have heretofore procured for 
the use of your Department. Should I not be able to send them by 
private conveyance in the course of six weeks, I will box and ship 
them to New Orleans, via. Baltimore. 

In your despatch of the 1st. of June, I was instructed to commu- 
nicate to the Grovemment of the United States, information of the 
outrage lately committed upon Col James Bourland, Collector of 
Red River, by certain citizens and officers of the United States, and 
to ask that the Government of the United States should take the 
necessary steps to afford such redress, as the circumstances of the 
case require. Enclosed I send you a copy of a communication which 
I made to Mr. Upshur Secretary of State upon the subject. So soon 
as an answer shall be received I will immediately transmit the same 
to your Department. 

The letter of the War Department to Col Warfield, was duly mailed 
to him at St Louis, with a request that should Col Warfield not be in 
the city, to forward the same to such* point as he would most probably 
receive it. It is impossible ito know here, where Col Warfield is at

198 AMEBIGAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIOK. 

Enclosed is a copy of my letter to Mr. Upshur of the 4th. inst in 
relation to the movements of Col. Warfield upon the border. 

In your dispatch of the 15th. of June last, I am instructed to defer 
for the present commimicating to the Grovemment of the United 
States the "declaration" contained in your prior dispatch of the 
10th. of the same month, but you suggest that I may suflFer the 
Secretary of State to peruse the whole of this last mentioned dispatch, 
as it indicates the course, which the Government may yet have to 
pursue. Believing the suggestion a good one, I have done so, and 
am gratified to find that the views of the Secretary coincide so well 
with my own, that in the event the present proposed negotiation 
for peace should fail, it will be the only proper course left for Texas 
to pursue. 

I feel the highest satisfaction at the course adopted by the Presi- 
dent, in agreeing with the armistice with Mexico as proposed by 
Santa Anna, not that I entertain any very sanguine hope that it will 
end in a lasting and permanent peace (for I fear, that Mexico is not 
at present disposed to acknowledge the independence of Texas, or 
if so at all, that the proposition will be coupled with other terms 
made as sine qua non conditions, which I am satisfied will not be 
acceded to by the President, and people of Texas,) but the measure 
will be productive of other salutary eflFects. While the armistice 
lasts it will remove every shadow of excuse, which may have been 
urged in justification of those evil disposed persons, who have con- 
stantly sought to agitate the people thereby creating confusion, and 
insubordination at home, and disgracing us as a nation abroad. It 
will afford a test of the efficacy of mediation by powers mutually 
friendly, and determine the pomt whether negotiation can or arms 
must decide the contest, in short, the result of the negotiations will 
settle for Texas the question of peace and of war. 

Since my return to the seat of Government, I have had several 
lengthy interviews with Mr. Upshur, the present Secretary of State, 
all of which have been of the most satisfactory character. In these 
interviews the present policy of the Administration, here, in relation 
to Texas has been fully indicated. 

Knowing the very great interest, which Mr. Upshur has always 
manifested in behalf of Texas, and believing the present a most 
auspicious moment for the United States, to again press their 
friendly offices of mediation and interposition, for the settlement 
of our difficulties, with Mexico, I deemed it proper to bring this 
subject again before the Secretary of State, urging the propriety of 
renewed and prompt action, upon the part of this Gt)vemment. I 
have now the honor to be able to communicate to you the result 
of this application^ which I hope will prove highly satisfactory to 
yourself as well as to His Excellency, the President.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 199 

Mr. Thompson the United States Minister in Mexico has been 
instructed, in the name of his Crovemment to protest, and remon- 
strate, in the most solemn maimer, against the late order of Santa 
Anna, which directed all foreigners taken in arms to be immediately 
put to death. Mr. Thompson is directed to say to the Mexican Gov- 
ernment that the United States view the said order as inhuman, and 
barbarous, and in violation of the rules of civilized warfare; and that 
it is impossible that they can look upon its execution witJi indiflFer- 
ence. A retrospective view is taken of the war with Texas, and the 
maimer in which the same has been waged for the last seven years; 
and Mr. Thompson is directed to say, that the United States have 
viewed with pain the predatory incursions which have been carried 
on, and that the contest, having lost the high character of war, as 
waged by civilized nations, deserves to be classed as a war of plunder, 
of pillage and robbery, and further that the United States deprecate 
a contest of such a character, and particularly the sanguinary and 
inhuman treatment, which has been extended to prisoners of war. 
The United States acknowledge the right of Mexico to resubjugate 
Texas if she have the ability, but they question her right, longer to 
keep the subject open, and they express the decided opinion that the 
war ought to be at once brought to a termination, either by negotia- 
tion or by arms, and that Mexico should either show herself a great 
nation, by her ability to resubjugate Texas, or a magnanimous one, 
by acknowledging her inability to do it — that by keeping the question 
imdecided she not only evinces her inability to resubjugate Texas, but 
a want of magnanimity by refusing to acknowledge her independence. 
It is also urged, that there is a public opinion among nations as well 
as individuals, and that no nation has the right to set herself above 
that opinion, nor can she do so mthout forfeiting the confidence, and 
incurring the censure of other nations. This is the general tone of the 
instructions, and Mr. Thompson is directed to urge these considera- 
tions in the strongest maimer possible, consistent with the relations 
of the two coimtries. A general view is also given of the situation, 
which Texas occupies towards the United States, and of the interest 
which the United States have in the success, and prosperity of Texas, 
and the maintenance of her institutions. 

These instructions I think evince the determination of the admin- 
istration to use every means in their power to terminate the contest 
between Texas and Mexico; the right to employ force, or in other 
words to declare way belongs alone to Congress. Had this decided 
tone been all along used by the United States, the effect would have 
been a good one. Coining as it now does while negotiations are pend- 
ing, I trust should Santa Anna be halting between two opinions it 
may incline him to peace.

Yours of the 6th. ultimo in relation to Uie subject of annexation has 
been received, but I have not thought it proper to mention to the 
Secretary of State, at the pres^it, that my instructions, in relation to 
that subject, had been suspended. I Hiought it possible, that it might 
interfere with my efforts in pressing the subject of interposition. I 
shall however in a few days make known to him verbally the fact 
according to your instructions.

I shall send to Mr. Cooper, gun maker New York, your answer rela- 
tive to his claim against Genl. Hunt. 

Nothing has been received by this Government from Genl. Thomp- 
son upon the subject of the armistice proposed by Santa Anna. 

Since the foregoing part of this dispatch was written I have reed, 
the National Intelligencer of today, which contains some particulars 
in relation to the disarming of Col. Snively, and his command upon 
the borders of Texas and the United States, by a force under Captain 
Cook, an officer of the United States army. As the official report of 
Col. Snively will likely require some action of your Department in 
relation to this matter, I herewith send you a slip from the paper 
alluded to, which will furnish all the information I have yet obtained 
upon the subject.* The subject has doubtless been communicated to 
the War Department of the United States, but as both the President 
and Secretary of War are now absent, I am unable to obtain any 
information from that Department concerning the same. 

I deem it unnecessary to offer any comment upon this outrageous 
proceeding, as I have no doubt our Gt)vemment will have had the 
same under consideration before this reaches your Department. I 
have the honor to be Very Respety,

Van Zandt to Jones.® 

Legation op Texas 
Washington [City], August 15{k. 1843 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 
Sm 

I have the honor herewith to transmit to you a copy of a letter, 
and of the documents which accompanied it, just received by me 
from the Hon A. P. Upshur, Secretary of State of the United States, 
in reply to my communication to him of the 8th. instant, upon the 
subject of the oytrage lately committed upon Col Bourland, the 
Collector of Red River, by certain citizens of the United States. Mr. 
Upshur informed me today in a personal interview, that he was using 
every exertion to obtain full information in regard to the case, and 
said he hoped soon to be able to communicate to me further in rela- 
tion to it. 

In a personal interview to day with Mr. Porter Secretary of War, 
that gentleman did me the kindness to suffer me to peruse the prin- 
cipal portion of the report, of the renowned Capt. Cook, who lately 
captured one hundred of our citizens under Colonel Snively. I enter- 
tain but little doubt that this affair occurred within the limits of 
iTexas, and cannot be considered in any other light, than as an 
enormous outrage. I deem it unnecessary to send you a synopsis 
of Capt. Cook's report, wh^ch fills several sheets of fools cap, and is 
evidently designed to be magnificently eloquent, and a full com- 
mentary upon international law, and the right of War. The affair 
having already terminated, I think it lumecessary to take any steps 
in relation to it here, until I receive the instructions of your Depart- 
ment. 

Gt)v Butler, late, United States Commissioner to Texas is here, and 
from him I have learned some facts relative to the contemplated 
Indian Coimcil, which I deem of importance, and accordingly sub- 
mit them for your information. He says, *'In a communication 
received by me from three Delaware Chiefs, Captains '* Roasting 
Ear," *'St Louis!' and ''Red TaU" dated about the first of July they 
say in substance, that they are just from the Commanche towns, 
where a Council was had on the subject of a treaty with Texas, 
which it would appear they had been invited to attend at some point 
on the Trinity River. Thej decline meeting there but express a 
willingness and desire to meet on the waters of Red River on the 
south side, and invite the countenance and cooperation of their 
Great Father, the President of the United States, some time in the 
early part of next winter, further that they had been advised by 

a[De«patchNo.l05.]

their Chickasaw, and Cherokee brothers not to make a treaty with Texas 
wifhovi they said so "* 

If this information be correct, which I do not doubt, then there is 
no probability that the Commanches will come in at the contem- 
plated period. Gov Butler says, further, that he is satisfied they 
will not come to Birds Fort, until they are first met higher up. 
Under these circumstances I fear some difficulty may arise, unless 
we can at once secure the full cooperation of the United States, and 
agree upon a concerted action. I think it also important as their 
influence is paramount with the Indians, that the United States 
should take the lead if possible in inviting them to the meeting. 

I have had a long conversation with Mr. Porter, the Secretary of 
War upon this subject, and have urged upon him the propriety of 
extending the instructions of the United States Commissioner, so as 
to make his Government a full party to the contemplated treaty, or 
that perhaps it might be better, as Gov Butler had the confidence of 
the Department, to revoke the former instructions and make the 
whole discretionary with him. The Secretary of War I think, will 
agree to the proposition; if he does, the question then arises, as to the 
place, the time etc. On this point I am not instructed. Gov Butler 
being here and on his way to South Carolina to remain for some time, 
would it not be better to arrange the whole now and let the necessary 
order issue? I think so, and entertaining this view I shall assume 
the responsibility, so far as the agreement of time, and place are con- 
cerned, satisfied that it will not interfere with any previous arrange- 
ment of the Presidents, can be productive of no harm, and may 
result with great advantage to Texas. Every treaty made with the 
Indians is so much gained, but my own opinion is, that a treaty made 
with the Commanches, in which the United States becomes the guar- 
antee, is worth a hundred treaties without it. I shall address a for- 
mal communication to the Secretary of State upon this subject on 
tomorrow, a copy of which, with his reply thereto I shall transmit to 
you as early as practicable. 

If I can obtain the sanction of this Government to send out some 
persons to invite the Indians in, it will likely be more effectual, and 
save us at the same time much expence. This I will endeavour to 
effect. 

I have the honor to be. Very Respct. Yr Obt. Servt.

COBRESPONDENCB WITH THE UNITED STATES. 203 

(Secretary of War to Secretary of State.) 
[Washington City, May 11, 1848. a) 

Sm: I respectfully transmit herewith copies of two letters just 
received from the Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs on the 
southwestern frontier, which induce a belief that there has been an 
interference of citizens of Texas with the private property and rights 
of citizens of the United States. 

The matter seems to have been referred to the Representative of 
this Government in Texas, and may become a subject of correspond- 
ence with the Department of State.

I have just been informed that the Steam Boat, Fort Towson loaded 
with goods for the different Merchants at Doakeville in the Choctaw 
nation, three of whom Col David Folsom Joel H Nail and Robert M 
Jones are Choctaws, have had their goods seized. The circumstances 
as I am informed are these. The Boat was unable to get up for want 
of water, and stored the goods on the Texas side, and returned to the 
raft. The goods were seized, and now are awaiting a trial. I under- 
stand that the case has been represented to our Chargfi d 'Affaires in 
Texas, and also that a memorial has gone to the President of the 
United States. This will produce excitement. It is a well known 
fact that no fraud was intended or that the owners of the goods had 
any control over them. It has been customary for boats to store 
their goods in this way. There are one or two boats above the raft 
employed as packets in carrying freight. I thought it my duty to 
communicate this affair to you and will give such further information 
as may be received. 

Very respectfully etc. (signed) Wm. Abmstbong

There was also a considerable lot of Grovemment freight stored which 
was also released. The Boat lies on the side of the Red River, unable

dispatches from this (Jovemment. Mr. EDsworth of the Patent 
Office has enclosed you by mail all the papers in relation to patents — 
all of which I hope in due time will arrive safe. 

I received a few days ago a letter from Dr. Smith, dated at Paris 
on the 1st. Inst. He enclosed me a copy of a dispatch which he 
had sent to your Department. As the facts mentioned are of 
importance and fearing some delay may have attended it, I have 
sent you a copy, so that if the original letter has not reached you, 
you may have the information which it contains.** 

The President, and all the Cabinet except Mr. Henshaw, are now 
absent and will not return for two or three weeks. Previous to the 
departure of the Secretary of War, I agreed with him in regard to 
the preliminaries of an Indian Council. I send you a copy of my 
letter to the Secretary of State upon this subject, a formal answer 
to which has not been received, and perhaps may not be until the 
Secretary returns. I have however the honor to inform you, that 
the necessary orders have issued from the War Department to Grov 
Butler, who has appointed the Commissioners, and directed them 
to start forthwith to invite the Indians in. A deputation of three 
persons is to go and they are to carry with them tobacco, and other 
presents to induce them to come in — they are to meet on the Texas 
side of Red River, and in the neighborhood of the mouth of Cache 
Creek,* which is a short distance above Coffee's station. The full 
moon in November is the time agreed upon. I would have prefered 
it earUer, but Gov Butler was of opinion that it was best to give 
full time, so as to prevent all difficulties. I hope the steps which I 
have thus taken may meet your approbation, and that in due time 
His Excellency the President will send Commissioners to attend the 
Council. It will be necessary to have a Uttle beef and perhaps a 
few bushels of com for the Indians. The United States will also 
send in some provissions, and presents to be given them at the 
Council. 

The final instructions which are to govern the Commissioners of 
the United States have not been given. I do not know to what 
extent they may go. I should have no difficulty if it were not for 
the cold notions of Mr. Crawford the Head of the Indian Bureau. 
I will do the best I can, satisfied that even a full, and friendly joint 
talk will be of much service. 

Since my dispatch of June, last, was written I have been enabled 
to obtain some important evidence in relation to the negroes of Dr 
Robinson,*' and I am now satisfied that I shall obtain an order for

of the United States, the fact, that my former instructions upon the 
subject of annexation, had been suspended, and that the Grovemment 
of Texas reserved the question for future consideration. Since I did 
this, I have not thought it proper for me to urge it again upon this 
Government. Nevertheless, in every interview, which I have had 
with the Secretary of State, Mr. Upshur, he has invariably mentioned 
the question, and dwelt upon its merits at some length; in fact, the 
announcement to him, that my instructions were suspended, seems to 
have fired him anew in regard to it. He has frequently inquired 
whether there had been a change in the views of the Texian Adminis- 
tration upon this subject; to this, I have always replied, in substance, 
that since my instructions were suspended, I had not been advised 
of the views of our Grovernment, and could only give him my unau- 
thorized opinion as an individual, which was this, that if the propo- 
sition was made to Texas, and with a strong probability the measure 
would succeed before the Senate of the United States, I thought it 
would be acceded to, but could not speak with certainty or authority. 
I further said to him, I did not deem it improper for me to communi- 
cate to him, (as he had interrogated me on the point) that portion of 
your dispatch of the 6th. July last in which you say "It is believed 
that the settlement of our difficulties with Mexico and the acknowl- 
edgment of our independence by that power will very much simplify 
the question of the annexation of Texas to the United States, and if, 
after this event, Texas should continue to desire this annexation, a 
treaty for the purpose would be more likely to succeed, and to meet 
with favour from the people of the United States, than if, as now 
that question were embarrassed with a question, and involved the 
contingency of a war between that Government and Mexico." In 
our several conversations alluded to, Mr, Upshur frequently remarked 
with much earnestness of manner, that he hoped Texas would not 
change her former poUcy on this subject; that it was the great meas- 
ure of the administration here, and that he was actively engaged 
under the instructions of the President, in preparing the minds of the 
people for. it, and in learning the views of Senators on the subject; 
and so soon as they conceived it safe, they would renew the proposi- 
tion on their part. 

I now proceed to submit for your information and consideration, 
the substance of a conversation had with the Secretary of State, to 
day, in relation to this matter. I called at the State Department 
this morning about the two negroes taken by the Indians from 
Dr. Joseph W. Robertson, of which you are further informed in 
another dispatch that accompanies this of the same date. On meet- 
ing Mr. Upshur he remarked, he was exceedingly glad I had called 
on him, that he was just in the act of addressing me a note requesting 
an interview. Without waiting to be informed of the object of my

visit, he proceeded in substance to say, that his object in wishing to 
see me, was to make known farther his views, and the wishes of the 
Executive on the subject of the anneication of Texas to the United 
States, that they now contemplated an early action thereon and that 
he was desirous I should immediately communicate this fact to your 
Department, in order that should the President of Texas still desire to 
conclude such a treaty, the Representative of Texas here, might be 
immediately clothed with the necessary powers to act upon the 
proposition, should it be submitted by the President of the United 
States, which proposition he now confidently believed would be 
made before the meeting of the next Congress — that from all the 
facts now before him he believed such a treaty might be safely sub- 
mitted to the next Senate, and entertaining this opinion he was 
desirous to act on it as early as practicable. He then stated at 
some length the grounds of his belief of a favorable action by the 
Senate of the United States, which were drawn from the views of 
various correspondents, and the manifestations of public sentiment, 
in different quarters of the country. I asked Mr. Upshur if soma of 
Mr. Tyler's cabinet were not still opposed to the measure, he replied, 
that one or two of the gentlemen perhaps might be, but the controlling 
iofluence was now decidedly in favour of action upon it. I then 
remarked to him, that though it might be possible our Grovemment 
might still desire to make the treaty, yet, I doubted xmder aU the 
circumstances whether the necessary powers would be given, unless 
the proposition was positively made, he replied that he could not 
make it at tins time nor would he likely be able to do so in time for 
me to communicate the fact to your department and obtain an 
answer before the meeting of Congress, but that he would repeat 
again what he had said before, that ^'he confidently believed he would 
be able to make the proposition before the meeting of Congress, and 
he hoped, if he did so, liat the Representative of Texas here wo\dd 
be sufficiently authorized to act at once." I then told him I wo\dd 
immediately communicate to my Government what he had said to me 
about the matter, and his wi^es in relation to the same; and so 
soon as an answer was received I would inform him of it. He asked 
what would be the probable length of time before an answer could be 
had. I repUed, I liiought between 30 and 40 days, if not longer, he 
then asked me if I did not deem the communication of sufficient 
importance to dispatch a special messenger with it, I replied, that 
I should not think it necessary unless the proposition was actually 
made. This he said he could not make, nor did he think it would 
be proper to do so, imless I had the necessary powers to negotiate; 
that if the Texian Government was yet in favour of the measure, no 
harm he thought could result from the conferring of provissional 
powers, to act in case the negotiation was proposed on their part,

I have thus given you the substance of our very lengthy conver- 
sation, in order that you may act upon it as advisedly as possible. 
It will need but few comments, as it explains itself fully. That the 
Secretary is serious in what he says, I have not a doubt, but whether 
he will carry out the measures indicated or not, is impossible to tell. 
My own opinion is that from the situation of poUtical affairs here, it 
is hard to know what, or whether any move will be made on any par- 
ticular question, until you have seen the step taken. That the Ad- 
ministration contemplate making the proposal of annexation I 
believe true. That they will do it is at best uncertain. If the treaty 
were concluded, and submitted to the Senate, no doubt the debate 
would be fierce and exciting, but I think it would be advantageous 
to the treaty, and in the end secure its adoption. 

For the great welfare, and prosperity of Texas, I beUeve nothing 
could contribute so much as her annexation to the United States, 
and, believing like views were entertained by our Government and 
people, up to the time of the receipt of your letter suspending my 
former instructions, I left untried no means, which I thought calcu- 
lated to advance or promote this object. 

Whether such be the views of the Executive at this time I am of 
course imadvised; facts and circumstances, known to him, may 
have changed his former opinions, and altered his policy in relation 
to this question. I have however given the facts as I understand 
them — ^it is not for me to determine what course should be taken by 
the Government. Whether the provissional powers shall be con- 
fered or not, is a matter which can alone be decided correctly, by 
the Executive with the aid of his advisers at home, who are presumed 
to know the whole situation of the country, its wishes and poHcy. 
Be the determination what it may, I hope no time will be lost in 
making the same known to me. And here suffer me to remark 
before closing this communication, that should the two Govern- 
ments determine to attempt the proposed measure, I am sensible the 
responsibiUty of the Agent of Texas must necessarily be great, and 
his actions require mtich judgment and deliberation. Should it 
therefore be the wish of the Executive to confer those powers upon 
any individual, other than myself, or upon any one in connexion 
with myself, I will cheerfully acquiese; iif confered upon me alone, 
conscious of their high importance I shall endeavour (if an action 
be had at all) to discharge the duty in strict compUance with the 
instructions which may be given by your department. 
With the highest sentiments 

of regard I have the honor to be

Legation of Texas 
^ Washington D, C. Sept. 18ih. I84S 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 
Sib 

I have the honor, herewith, to enclose you a copy of a letter, 
received from the Secretary of State of the United States, dated the 
7th. Inst, together with a copy of a letter from the Chief Clerk of the 
War Department, and an extract of a communication from the Com- 
missioner of Indian Affairs, which accompanied the letter of the Sec- 
retary of State; and also a copy of my letter, of the 14th. Inst, 
acknowledging the receipt of the communication above referred to. 
These several communications, with the facts already in your posses- 
sion, will give you information of all the proceedings which have been 
had here in relation to the contemplated Indian Council. All of 
which I hope will meet the concurrence of your Department, and 
that the necessary steps will be taken to secure a corresponding action 
on the part of our Government. 

I send you also a copy of my letter, to the Secretary of State, of 
the United States, of the 14th. Inst, calling his attention to the sub- 
ject of the capture of the two negroes of Dr. Robertson, which had 
heretofore been a matter of correspondence between the two Gov- 
ernments. After my letter was written, and before it had been sent, 
I received a communication from Mr. Upshur of the same date, upon 
the same subject, which assumed entire different, and adverse grounds 
to those assumed by me. Believing the letter must have been 
written without reflection, I determined to send mine, and pay no 
attention to that of the Secretary, until I could see him personally, 
which I did on today. After adverting to the case, and discussing 
it, Mr. Upshur requested me to return his letter, in order that he 
might reconsider the matter, promising me at the same time an early 
answer. I cannot beUeve, but that the negroes will be surrendered. 
With the testimony which I have produced to the Department, I do 
not know how they can avoid it. I shall give the subject every 
attention and advise you as early as possible of the result. In inves- 
tigating this matter, I have discovered important information in 
regard to an illicit trade carried on with the wild Indians of Texas, 
by traders from the United States, of which I made complaint, under 
your instructions last winter, and which was denied by Mr. Spencer 
the then Secretary of War. So soon as I can embody all the facts I

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two des-

letter of the 12th. and Mr. Raymond's of the 20th of the same month — 
all of which are satisfactory to the Department. 

My last communication to you was of the 20th. of Augt. and was 
necessarily very brief on account of the severe illness of myself and

Cols. Sam W. Williams and Geo. W. Hockley have been appointed, 
Commissioners on the part of this Govt, to arrange the terms of the 
Armistice between Texas and Mexico, with Commissioners to be 
named by Gen. Adrian Woll, Commander in Chief of the Army of 
the North, and left this on the 26th Inst, for Matamoros. As you 
will see by the enclosed Proclamation of the President the Mier and 
other prisoners are to be at once released by Gen. Santa Anna. 
Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit you copies of some 
recent correspondence with Capt. Elliot on this subject for your 
information. 

You will embrace an early opportimity and respectfully but 
urgently press upon the government of the United States a prompt 
reparation for the outrage committed upon Mr. James Bouriand 
Collector of the District of Red River and the pubhc revenue as 
conmiunicated to you in a former despatch. The disposition which 
has recently been evinced by officers of that Government in command 
on the frontier adjoining ours must be very promptly checked, or it 
will inevitably lead to a breach of the good understanding now 
existing, between the two countries and which it has ever been the 
earnest desire and effort of this government to maintain and per- 
petuate. The amount of property illegally taken from the collector 
in the instance complained of was as is supposed about Seventy 
thousand dollars, for which sum you will make a formal reclamation 
on the Govt of the U. S. as well as for proper satisfaction for the 
insult given to this Government in the person of its officer, and for the 
grievous personal injury sustained by him, from the armed force, 
which under the coimtenance and protection of the commander of Fort 
Towson so recklessly invaded our territory The principles of inter- 
national law which govern this case are so plain in their character 
that it makes it quite unnecessary I should specify the arguments 
which it will be proper for you to use in support of this just demand. 
The collector, siezed the property in conformity with our laws, and 
the owners by resorting to force, without waiting for the clemency 
of the government to interpose in their behalf, forfeited all claim 
upon that clemency. 

The course adopted by the United States in interposing her good 
offices to effect a termination of the war between this country and

Mexico as indicated in ,your despatch of the 10th Ulto. is highly satis- 
factory to the President. Coming as it does at the moment when 
the two countries are about to commence friendly negotiations, it 
will doubtless have a very favorable influence upon the councils of 
Mexico. 

Commissioners are now at Birds Fort,* in council with the various 
smaller tribes of hostile Indians and it is very probable a treaty of 
peace will be effective with them. As you anticipate, the Com- 
manches declined attending at that place. Col. J. C. Eldridge, who 
with Messrs Torrey and Bee, and the three Delaware Indians, Secondi, 
John Connor and Jim Shaw was sent to these Indians by the Presi- 
dent, fell in with them high upon the Canadian River. Pd-Jia-yw-co 
the principal Chief and many others expressed themselves favorably 
to peace, and agreed to come to the Commanche Peak on the Brazos 
at the time of the full moon in December to hold a council for that 
purpose. In the mean time they promised to send out runners to 
notify the scattered bands of this arrangement and to summon 
them to attend at that time and place. They also promised to 
cease hostilities, on their own part against Texas and to restrain 
the others from committing any as far as in their power to do. Should 
the United States agree to the proposal you may have made, it will 
probably be well to despatch runners immediately to notify the In- 
dians of the fact. In order however to give full time for the recip- 
rocal action of the two government as well as to consult all the 
various Indian tribes the President thinks the full moon in May 
next, will be early enough for the council. As it regards the place, 
he wishes some point on the Brazos fixed on if possible — if not, he 
will consent to the Red River as the point of meeting. There will 
not, it is presumed, be time for the Government of the U. S. to send 
out and ascertain the views and wishes of the Indians and then to 
send, a Commissioner to the Commanche Peak or Clear Fork of the 
Brazos by the full moon in December If so the council to be held 
there might be made introductory to the one proposed to be held in 
May — or perhaps might be dispensed with, and made to correspond 
with the arrangement you may have made with the Government of the 
United States. It is extremely desireable that the U. States should 
become a party and a guarantor to a treaty with the hostile Indians 
within and upon our borders — and if you can effect an arrangement 
for that purpose you w411 do so, and report the same as early as 
practicable. If a Commissioner can attend at the Commanche 
Peak on the Brazos in December, it may possibly answer every 
purpose. You will consult on all these points with the Grovt. at 
Washington, and in view of the facts and suggestions now commu- 
nicatedi agree as may be mutually deemed most proper. It will of

course be always borne in mind that a season of the year should if 
possible be fixed upon, when there is a plenty of grass, in order that 
horses etc. may be subsisted, without com. 

The appointment of Governor Butler as Commissioner on the part 
of the U. States to attend the Indian Council was most acceptable to 
this Govt, and it is hoped that he may be again named in case, the 
United States should agree to send one to the Council now proposed. 
Whoever may be appointed however you will immediately notify 
this Department of the same, as it may be necessary for this Govern- 
ment to communicate with him directly. 

Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit you a copy of the 
Official report to the Department of War and Marine, of Col. Jacob 
Snively lately in command of an expedition on our northwestern 
frontier — and also a copy of the instructions under which that officer 
was acting. By this report you will percieve, that a most extraordi- 
nary outrage has been committed, upon this Officer and his Men by 
Capt. Cooke, an officer of the U. States Army who in contempt of all 
laws human and divine recklessly invaded our territory, captured the 
command under Col. Snively disarmed and abused the officers and 
men, and turned them adrift in a wilderness several hundred miles 
from any settlement with only five guns to protect them from the 
hordes of ruthless savages by whom they were surrounded and to 
procure by hunting the necessary means to save them from starva- 
tion and death. 

The President therefore directs that you, make a prompt and 
energetic appeal to the Government of the United States in relation 
to the conduct of this officer, as well as that of Gen. Gaines by whose 
authority and under whose sanction as appears from his published 
letter to Brig. Gen. Taylor* this most unheard of outrage upon 
national rights has been committed. You will ask also for the dis- 
missal of these officers, and for ample compensation to the menimder 
command of Col. Snively, for the injuries sustained by them and for 
the loss of their arms. 

The act of Congress of the year 1836^ defined the limits of the 
Republic of Texas, and according to that act, Santa F6 and all that 
portion of country lying between the Rio Grande and the Territory 
of the United States is included within our declared limits. Within 
these limits Texas has been acknowledged sovereign by the United 
States Great Britain France and the Netherlands. The right to 
regulate trade is one of the attributes of sovereignty, and this country 
properly claims that right. For some time past an illicit and con- 
traband commerce has been carried on through our territory from

Missouri and Arkansas, with the settlements upon and beyond the 
Rio Grande. Goods to an immense amount have been introduced, 
in violation of our revenue laws, both by hostile Mexicans, and by 
citizens of the United States, a state of things which it has become 
the duty of this govemment to interrupt and prevent. 

The right claimed by Gen. Gaines in his published letter above re- 
fered to, and upon which principle Capt Cooke appears to have acted, 
in disarming Col Snively, to avail himself of the boundary line be- 
tween Texas and the United States being immarked, to occupy all the 
territory between the latter country and the Rio Grande, would appear 
to give this government a right upon the same principle to assert a 
similar claim to the occupancy of all the territory between Texas 
and the Mississippi river — an absurdity which if attempted to be 
carried into practical effect would necessarily lead to war at once 
between the two countries. It is to be hoped that the Government 
of the United States will promptly disavow the acts of these their 
officers, and the principles assumed by them — ^principles which would 
authorize every species of aggression, upon our national rights, and 
ultimately lead to an entire subversion of them. 

You will ther^ore lay this whole subject before the government of 
the United States from whose justice, magnanimity and friendly 
disposition the President confidently reUes for the adoption of a 
course which will afford proper and speedy satisfaction for the 
wrongs now complained of. If on the contrary this satisfaction 
should not be awarded us, no other course will be left the President 
than to recall you, and to submit the matters in dispute to the 
umpirage of Great Britain and France. In your official intercourse 
with the Secretary of State of the U. States, if you find that satis- 
factory redress is not likely to be awarded us you can verbally inform 
him that this course will have ultimately to be adopted. You will 
however use every persuasive means to obtain justice from the govern- 
ment of the United States, and I sincerely hope the result may be 
favorable and that the good understanding heretofore existing 
between the two countries may remain undisturbed. It is certainly 
for the best interests of both that such should be the case. 

Enclosed herewith I also send a request of his Ebccellency the 
President of Texas, on his Excellency the President of the United 
States, that he will cause to be delivered up one Hiram Kenley a 
refugee from justice in this country. It will probably be better that 
you should first make an informal application, in order to ascertain 
whether the President of the United States would accede to such a 
request, or not. If he should consent to the proposition, you can 
then make the application in form. Gen. J. Pinckney Henderson 
and Mr. Bayne will go bn to Kentucky in Octr. or Novr. next, and 
you will please write to Gen. Henderson informing him of the answer

Sec^y of War and Marine^ 

Sir, 

In my report of 29th June,'' I omitted to give you a statement of 
the course and distance I marched from Georgetown, near CoflFee's 
Station, to the Arkansas River. When I took up the line of march 
on the 25th April last, my course was nearly due West, which course 
I continued 150 miles, and which carried me at least 50 miles west of 
100^, West Longitude. Then I crossed the River and marched from 
that point N. 20°, W. (by the Compass) till I fell on the Arkansas, 
marching 275 miles, which brought nje 60 miles East of the crossing 
of the Santa F6 road, and at least 57, west of the point where the 
line between the two Governments would intersect the River. Being 
satisfied that I was correct in my calculations, I felt no hesitation in 
ordering the Battallion to march to the River, on the 29th June for 
the purpose of procuring supplies of Buffaloe meat, there being none 
on Crooked Creek where I was then encamped. The same evening 
we reached the River 45 miles East of the crossing. The next morn- 
ing June 30th, a party of men were dispatched to kill BuflFalo. After 
having been unsuccessful on the Texas side, they crossed the River, 
seeing numerous herds on that side, and while in pursuit of them 
they discovered them to be S Dragoons approaching, and having

been discovered at the same time.^ The party immediately returned 
to the encampment, pursued to the Riveras brink. In a very short 
time the whole command under Capt Cooke appeared in sight. He 
then dispatched LH. Lovell to my encampment, for the purpose of 
ascertaining who we were, and who was the Commanding Officer, 
his questions being answered. He then informed me that the 
Com'dg Officer, Capt Cooke, desired him to say, that if I would visit 
him on the opposite side, I should have a free passport. I accompa- 
nied L't* L. When I arrived Capt C. requested to see my orders. 
After having perused them, he observed 'Hhat it was his opinion, 
that I was encamped on the Territory of the U. States. He then 
retired with his Officers, held a short consultation,, returned and 
stated that his Officers were of the same opinion, and that he had 
come to the conclusion to disarm me. To this I protested, giving 
him an outline of the course which we marched, and also that the 
line was not defined, and that he could not point it out. But noth- 
ing I could say or do had any effect. **He had made his terms, and 
to them I must submit." He threatened me with his Artillery and 
Dragoons, and that if one of my men attempted to escape, he would 
throw his shells into the encampment, and send his Dragoons across 
the River to cut the command to pieces. He had under his Com- 
mand 196 men, and the advantage of two field pieces, and in fact 
his superiority of discipline. Horses and Arms, gave him a decided 
advantage. At length he gave me permission to leave with orders 
to recross the River, allowing me one hour to bring over the Batn., 
and lay down our Arms. I left him for the purpose of submitting 
the terms to the men. I had proceeded but a short distance, when I 
was recalled and informed that Capt C. would accompany me. I 
was under the impression that he alone would cross with me. What 
was my astonishment, when the Bugle sounded the advance! On 
came the Cavalry and Artillery, crossed over, formed line of battle 
in my rear, with colums on each flank, the Artillery in the centre, two 
hundred yards distant, with port fires lit. When he observed *Hhe 
time was growing short, and that I must march out the men, and 
order them to stack their Arms." This was done, when the men 
clamoured to be received as prisoners of War. I requested Capt 
Cooke to receive them as such. He said that **he had made his 
terms, and if they were not satisfied, they should receive worse," 
intimating, that if they were not satisfied, he would fall on them and 
put them to death, unarmed as they were. He then recrossed the 
River leaving ten rifles to 107 men. The next morning, July, the 1st, 
Capt. C. sent over a Detachment, commanded by Capt Moore request- 
ing me to bring over the men, in order that he might protect them

against the hostile Indians and Mexicans, who were supposed to be 
in the neighbourhood. I done so, and when I halted, He addressed 
the men, and offered an Escort to all who wished to go to Inde- 
pendence M'o. About 50 men took that rout, to whom he gave 3 
of the 10 Guns he left in our hands. The balance would not accept 
an escort, unless, guarded to Texas. With this request he said he 
could not comply. To this party he allowed five guns, to make their 
way through the hostile bands of Indians. He ordered me at the 
same time to leave the Territory of the U. States as quick as possible. 

The same evening after having surrendered our Arms I sent an 
express to Capt Chandler, who with his company of 74 men were 
found on Elmn Creek, about eight miles distant, and who had a few 
days previous been ordered home. The next morning, July 1st, I 
marched to Elmn Creek and encamped. On the 2nd. I dispatched 
Elish. C. Simmons and Francis Sharp to spy out the Caravan. They 
never returned. I presume they were killed by a party of Comman- 
ches with whom we had a skirmish on the 3d. This day I again 
sent out two men to spy out the Caravan, and was joined by Chandler. 
On the 4th. the Indians again attempted to stampead. They suc- 
ceeded in driving off 60 or 70 horses, and killed Cddwell on Piquet, 
and lanced a man by the name of Duncan. They were hotly pur- 
sued by about thirty men, only eleven succeeded in overtaking 
them, who engaged sixty Indians and killed from 8 to 15 of them. 
The Horses, however, were not recovered. 

On the 8th. the Spies returned, and reported that the Caravan had 
crossed the Arkansas at the usual crossing, and that it was on the 
road towards Santa F6, about 30 or 40 miles from where we were 
then encamped. On the 9th. finding nearly all Capt. Chandler's 
men unwilling to pursue the Caravan I resigned the Command. 

I have the honor to be. Very respectfully.

October 16th. 1843 
Honorable 

Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 

Sib, 

On the 18th. ultimo I had the honor to make a communication to 
your Department on the subject of annexation. I have now the 
honor to submit for your information, and consideration a com- 
munication upon the same subject this day received by me, from the 
Hon A. P. Upshur, Secretary of State of the United States. This 
conamunication you will perceive, places that question at once in a 
tangible shape, it comes to the point, and presents the issue; Are we 
ready to negotiate a treaty of annexation, or not t 

This question has engaged the attention of the Government of 
Texas, at different times since 1837 and has been pressed at aU times, 
whenever there was an apparent prospect of success. From this 
I infer that heretofore there has been no policy of the Government 
more settled, than that of annexation to this country. The instruc- 
tions from yoin* Department suspending my former instructions 
upon this subject, I did not construe as an evidence of any radical 
change in the mind of the Government, as to its wishes in regard to 
the question, but that the desire of the Government still was to be 
annexed, whenever practicable. The (Jovemment at present is 
using every effort to obtain a peace with Mexico, not perceiving that 
a treaty of annexation can in any wise miUtate against that object. I 
entertain the opinion that the subject now presented by the Secretary's 
letter will be met in a corresponding spirit, on the part of our Govern- 
ment, and that the powers will be furnished to the Texian Representa- 
tive here to conclude such a treaty. This opinion, as an individual, 
I have expressed to the Secretary of State, at the same time dis- 
claiming any authority on the part of my Government for such an 
opinion.

222 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Believing that the question of annexation is fraught with con- 
sequences of the first magnitude, and if consumated calculated in an 
eminent degree to advance the welfare, and prosperity of the country, 
I have thought it my duty to dispatch this communication by a 
special messenger, in order to apprise your Department as early as 
possible, and that no time may be lost in ascertaining on my part 
the determination of the Government. Having no means to employ 
a special agent for this purpose, and moreover, as it is difficult to 
embody in a communication without much time and labor, the many 
facts which it would be important to be known to your department 
touching this matter, all of which are familiar to Mr. Raymond 
Secretary of Legation, at my request he has consented to take charge 
of this dispatch and depart for Texas immediately. To him I must 
refer you for information in regard to many matters bearing on 
this question. 

I am of opinion, that at no time since the question was first pre- 
sented to this Government, have there been so many circumstances 
combining to secure the favorable action of the Senate of the United 
States. The late declarations of Lord Aberdeen in the British 
Parliament, in reply to the interrogatories of a certain Noble Lord, 
show the designs of the British Government in regard to the institu- 
tions of the United States through Texas, and make at once, the 
question, one of vital importance to the slave holding states. The 
possibility of England's (as many believe) securing an undue influence 
in Texas, and thereby monopoUzing her growing trade, seems to 
have touched the secret springs of interest so fondly cherished by 
northern manufacturers, and presented the question in a form 
hitherto unheeded. The West are intent on the occupation of 
Oregon, in order to wrest it from the grasping power of Great Britain — 
it is believed that the interest of the two questions of the annexation 
of Texas, and the occupation of Oregon can be combined, securing for 
the latter the south and southeastern votes and for the former some 
northern and the entire western vote. Those presses which have 
discussed the matter place it above party grounds and unshackled 
with party trammels. This I think is highly advantageous for if it 
were made a strictly party vote, neither of the two great parties 
have sufficient members to carry it. Should the treaty be con- 
cluded some provission would necessarily be made for our Govern- 
ment Uabilities — this would at once secure the influence of the holders 
thereof in this country. The influence, of the old United States 
Bank agents, though the bank itself is dead in law, would prove a 
host in itself. It has been told me, and by one entitled to confidence 
that some of these holders of our Uabilities have lately interested 
in a pecuniary way, a distinguished lawyer, a whig senator from one 
of the northern States, who if necessary would settle in Texas in

order to prosecute measures to secure their claims. Then, if under 
all these circumstances we should reject this proposition, there can be 
but little probability that so propitious a moment will soon, if ever 
again occur. 

With these hasty remarks I submit the matter for the determination 
of His Excellency the President, aided by his Constitutional advisers, 
with a fervent wish that his decission may redound to the welfare and 
prosperity of Texas. 

In view of the financial condition of Texas, and believing that the 
Legation imder the circumstances might dispense with the Services 
of a Secretary, Mr. Raymond had expressed to me his intention, at an 
early day, to tender to the President his resignation. Now, should 
the Government decide to make the treaty of annexation, I conceive 
that it will be highly necessary that the services of a Secretary of 
Legation should be retained, at least for the present. If therefore 
you should concur with me in opinion I hope that you will so mani- 
fest it to Mr. Raymond, that he may be induced to continue his 
services as Secretary of Legation. His knowledge of the duties of his 
station, aside from other considerations, renders it desirable that he 
should be retained, if an action be decided on. 

It is but due to Mr. Raymond, and it affords me. much pleasure on 
this occasion to bear testimony to your Department, of the prompt- 
ness, fideUty and ability with which he has at all times discharged his 
official duties, and while I most cordially commend him to you, I feel 
assured that the confidence which is now or may hereafter be reposed 
in him by Government will never be misplaced. 

If the Grovemment determine to furnish to its agent here full powers 
to negotiate the proposed treaty, I think the instructions, which 
accompany them, should be as full and expHcit as possible imder the 
circumstances 

I have also the honor herewith to communicate to the Department 
the copy of a letter received from Hon. Fernando Wood of New York, 
giving information of certain alledged violations of official duties, by 
J. H. Brower Esq, Texian Consul of that city. Upon the receipt of 
this letter, I addressed a note to Mr. Brower acquainting him of the 
charges against him, and requesting his statement of the circum- 
stances connected with the affair. His reply is herewith enclosed. 
The two statements, between which there appears to be a very great 
variance, contain all I have learned in relation to the occurrence. 
So far as I have heretofore had an opportimity of knowing, Mr. 
Brower has deported himself properly, and given general satisfaction. 
Unless other testimony be adduced to show his culpabiHty, I appre- 
hend he will receive no serious censure from the Department. 

Should this view concur with that of His Excellency, the President, 
I would respectfully suggest, that perhaps it might not be improper

for the Department to address a communication to Mr. Brower, 
impressing upon bjm the importance of avoiding as much as possible

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt on yesterday of your 
communication of the 29th September last, together with a copy of 
a certain correspondence with Capt Elliott British Charge d' Affaires, 
also the demand of the President for the delivery of Hiram Kenley

The several matters embraced in your communication and accom-

require some little time to execute all your instructions, I deem it 
proper first to submit for your consideration some reflections of mine 
upon some of the points to which my attention has been directed, 
together with a succinct statement of the condition of some of the 
various questions heretofore pending. The last I notice fir^t.

Annexed you will find a copy of my reply to Mr Upshnrs note upon 
the subject of annexation. I thought it best as my instructions 
stood to make no intimation of Opinion upon the subject but simply 
to inform the Secretary that a copy of his note was submited for 
the determination of the Grovemment. This question app>ears to 
receive daily, increased interest here, not only with the Government 
but the people also. It is the leading mattier of inquiry by almost 
every prominent man I meet. The opinion of those friendly to the 
measure is that should such a treaty be in contemplation, at no time 
since the subject was first agitated, has there been so many circum- 
stances combining to facilitate its ratification. Mr Adams mani- 
fests great alarm. In a speech of more than two hours length to 
his constituents lately, he occupied the principal portion of the time 
in discussing the subject and the matters connected therewith. I 
hope that before this, you have received my despatches in regard to 
it and have given it a favorable consideration 

The instructions final have been sent to Gov Butler who is Com- 
missioner to meet the Indians. I found it impossible to obtain the 
sanction of this Government to conclude such a treaty as would make 
the United States a guarantee for the faithful performance of the 
conditions The present Secretary of War and Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs as well as Mr Spencer late Secretary of War and now 
of the Treasury, were uncompromising in their opposition. The 
commissioner is however directed to use all his powers to affect [sic] 
a treaty of peace between Texas and the Indians. The commissioner 
of Indian affairs has Ukewise addressed letters to the principal chiefs 
of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek Nations to persuade 
them not to oppose but to use their influence with the wild Indians 
to induce them to conclude a peace with Texas. From the tenor 
of your communication I fear that the time agreed upon will not be 
entirely convenient for our Government. In regard to this I can 
only say that I have acted with the best Ughts upon me and hope 
the Department may be able to carry out the arrangements 

Since the date of my last dispatch to your department I have fre- 
quently called on the Secretary of State and urged upon him the 
necessity of taking up the case of the outrage upon Col Bourland the 
collector of Bed Biver. He has universally replied to me that he 
had not yet been able to procure all the testimony upon the subject 
but that he hoped soon to receive it when he would at once take it 
up In your communication now before me I am instructed to make 
a demand for indemnity for the supposed amount of goods taken 
from the collector. I entertain some doubt whether the claim if 
now made can be held as well founded, since in making the demand 
for reperation for the vnrongs done the collector we presented the fact 
that the goods had been ordered to be released and communicated

at the same time a copy of those orders. I take this to be the rule 
in civil cases that if an officer has taken possession of property and 
an order is afterwards issued from the proper authority for its release 
and in the mean time before the Officer is advised of the order of 
release the property is wrested from his possession and returned to 
its original possessor, though the party would be liable to a prosecu- 
tion for the tresspass or violence if used, yet it would in no degree 
affect his title to the property or make him liable for its value at the 
suit of any other person not even the officer himself. If in this lam 
correct I apprehend that the principle is no less true in a national 
point of view. I merely submit these reflections for your consider- 
ation, not as controlling my action for as your instructions are un- 
equivocal I shall seize the earliest opportunity to make the demand 
and will urge it by every means in my power. There is one other 
point in this case to which I call your attention. Col Bourland states 
that it can be established that the offenders were aided or countenanced 
by a United States officer, Col Loomis. I have had some conversation 
with Col Armstrong Indian Agent on this subject and from his state- 
ment I think it will be difficult to identify the officer in any manner 
with the outrage. I would therefore suggest to your Department 
the propriety of calling on Col Bourland to procure such testimony 
as he may be able to obtain touching this particular point and com- 
municate the same to me as early as possible Since the date of my 
letter to Mr Upshur Secretary of State upon the subject of Dr Rob- 
ertsons negroes, I have given the matter my frequent attention but 
up to the present time I regret to have to say that no deffinite action 
has yet been taken upon it by the Government of the United States. 
The Secretary of State in our early discussions upon the matter 
presented and urged many objections to delivering up the negroes, 
all of which I think I have met successfully not only to my satis- 
faction but that of the Secretary of State. In our last interview on 
the subject Mr Upshur said that he would confess to me candidly 
that he was convinced that the United States ought to deliver up the 
negroes and that he was anxious himself to do so but that the oppo- 
sition of some of the cabinet was so great that as yet he had been 
unable to procure the sanction of the President to that course. I 
told him that the great delay which had occurred in this case was well 
nigh tantamount in its effects to a rejection and a longer procrasti- 
nation of the. question could not fail to be viewed by the President 
of Texas as manifesting a disposition on the part of the Government 
of the United States to avoid the performance of an act manifestly 
called for by the plainest treaty stipulations. Mr Upshur said he 
would do all he could to accord to Texas her rights but in the mean 
time hoped that neither this question nor those connected with the 
border difficulties, should be permitted to interpose obstacles to the

accomplishment of the important object of annexation. I replied 
that I was sure that it was the most ardent desire of the President of 
Texas to cultivate the most friendly relations with the United States, 
but at the same time I thought nothing could so much contribute to 
the mantainance of a good imderstanding between the two countries 
as a prompt and ready accordance of right 

I am gratified to receive your instructions upon the subject of the 
disarming of Col Snivelys command. This was a great outrage and 
demands reperation. I was strongly inclined to act on this matter 
at an earlier day, knowing the delay necessarily attendant upon the 
circuitous route by which Col Snively's report would be sent, but as 
I would have had to rely upon newspaper statements which were 
uncertain and contradictory I finaUy concluded to await the receipt 
of intelligence from your Department in regard to it. I shall imme- 
diately make the coAununication to this Grovemment upon the sub- 
ject as directed in your instructions, 

*♦*♦♦♦ Jlta 

I will see the President on Monday, (to day being Saturday and 
the usual day for the meeting of the Cabinet,) upon the subject of the 
delivery of the refugee Henley ^ and will write to Genl Henderson the 
result. 

I am exceedingly gratified to find that amidst all our difficulties 
our prospects are brightning. I think that there is much grounds 
to indulge the hope that ere long Texas will sum^oimt the obstacles 
which have retarded her progress and by the successful prosecution 
of a proper policy find herself again restored to peace and prosperity. 
With Sentiments of high regard I am

Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary ofStaie of Texas 

Sir 

I have the honor to enclose you a copy of my communication of the 
10th Instant to the Hon. A P Upshur Secretary of State of the United 
States upon the subject of the disarming of Majr Snively by Capt 
Cook. I have examined a variety of correspondence when similar 
difficulties have arisen and the usual course seems to be to make the 
complaint in a clear and decided tone, while the manner of reperation 
is first somewhat left to the magnanimity of the party who has com- 
mited the wrong and in the event that sufficient attonement is not 
made then the demand is made in a more peremptory manner. I 
have adopted this course so far and hope it may meet your concur- 
ence, as I feel assured you can not have a greater desire than myself 
promptly to vindicate our rights when thus rudely assailed. In con- 
nexion with this subject I would submit to your Department whether 
we ought not to require of this Government that for the indignity 
offered to our flag it should be hoisted in some of the Western Garri- 
sons nearest the point where Snively was disarmed and saluted with 
a number of Guns. If Snively had with him a flag I have no doubt 
we ought to require it Some time since I had an interview with the 
Secretary of State on the subject, he said he had not yet fully investi- 
gated the matter but was then engaged on it. He supposed it doubt- 
ful whether the act was commited within the territory of Texas, but 
be that as it might he considered it a most extraordinary one, wholly 
inexcusable and one that demanded the strongest censure. He was 
unable to say what would be the final determination of the President 
but promised to advise me at the earliest day possible. I asked him 
what he thought of Genl Gains's ^ letter he replied by asking me if 
my Government did not know that he (Gains) was considered a crazy

man. I told him the Texian Government believed his acts proved 
him one, but did not know he was so considered by his own Govern- 
ment He said he considered him so and that the President was desir- 
ous to dispense with his services but that he was at a loss in regard 
to him that during the last war he was a valuable officer, but was now 
in a great degree unfit for the service. In a conversation with the 
President in regard to Genl Gains's letter he said that such latitu- 
dinous doctrine[s] were never entertained by him (the President) nor 
was General Gaines authorized to promulgate them In regard to 
Cooks conduct the President remarked that the subject was a very 
perplexing one and he was at a loss to know what to do in relation to 
it. I told him I could not see any grounds for hesitation and I hoped 
the question would be promptly met. It was important for the 
Texian Government to know and that by an official declaration 
whether the acts complained of were sanctioned by the Grovemment 
of the United States or not. My own impression is that this Govern- 
ment will attempt to stave off this matter at present as [it did] the 
outrage upon Col Bourland and the case of Dr Robinsons negroes. I 
think there is no good reason for this and unless I shall receive an 
answer soon I shall deem it my duty to urge their consideration in the 
most express and decided tone 

The question of annexation is gathering in importance every day. 
The papers are full on the subject by far the greater number are in 
favor, though some are very hostile to the measure. The Opinion 
of members of Congress friendly to it is that if the treaty is concluded 
it must prevail while others opposed say it is impossible. The 
President wiU not (as has been expected here) allude to it in his 
message. 

Mr Fox the British Minister is to be recalled Mr Packenham 
formerly Minister at Mexico is to succeed him, this however is yet 
secret here generally but it comes from^ and I think is true. 

Some very belligerent communications have passed between Mr 
Upshur and Genl Almonte in which the latter threatens a declaration 
of war in certain contingences which you will understand* I speak 
advisedly. Genl Almonte has not either officially or otherwise 
visited the Secretary of State for some considerable time past 

On yesterday I was assured by a leading member of Congress that 
the Globe of this city is making ready to wield its mighty force on 
the side of annexation the moment a treaty is concluded. The 
inteligencer is perplexed. The Editor is opposed but some of his 
party are trying to bring him over to the measure. I fear it cant 
be done he may be neutralized perhaps. I have got some strong 
Whigs beseiging him who will do all that is possible for them. Mr

Clay could eflfect this object, but I fear he will be disposed to take

will succeed.

Legation of the Unfted States, 

Galveston, Texas, 
1st, December 1843. 
To the Honbl. 

Anson Jones, 

Sect of State, of the Reph. of Texas. 
Sir, 

The undersigned, Charge d' Affaires of the U. States, near the 
Government of the RepubUc of Texas, has to perform the painful 
duty of communicating to you, the circumstances incident, to a most 
unprovoked murder, recently committed at the Pine Bluffs, in Texas, 
of a choctaw warrior, named Daniel Wesley, by a white man, named 
George Albon. 

It appears, from the evidence, on file in the office of this Legation, 
(copies of which, will be furnished to the Government of Texas, if 
required) that on the 4th of September last the murderer, George 
Albon, who had been left in charge of the Grocery of Messrs Matthews 
and Stiles at the Pine Bluffs, having traded some whiskey, or other 
intoxicating Liquors to the deceased and another Choctaw Indian, 
named *' Charley", for a Buckskin, upon which the two Indians 
became very much intoxicated, shoved them boath out of the Door 
of the House, boath Indians falling prostrate on the groui^d, out 
side of the Door. Whereupon, Albon, went out, and as Daniel 
Wesley was getting up, Albon struck him on the side of the head 
with a Hoe, or some dangerous weapon, fracturing his scull, from 
the back part of the Head to the front Temple, protruding one eye 
nearly out of his head. Fracturing the Temporal and parital bones 
of the left side of the Head, the several edges of the bones pressing 
upon and lacerating the Brain, of which, the Poor Indian died in a 
few hours.

COKEESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 231 

To you sir, or to your Government, I need not describe the deep 
sensation, the ardent desire of revenge, which this unhappy event, 
created throughout the whole tribe of Choctaw warriors, and the 
neighbouring tribes of Indians affiliated with them. 

I may say however; that it required the utmost prudence, and 
energy on the part of the Civil and Military authorities of the United 
States, near the scene of murder, to check the exasperated warriors, 
from seeking redress by the only means they generally adopt, of an 
indiscriminate slaughter of the first victims that chanced to fall in 
their way. 

This vigelance and prompt action, of our officers, I am happy to 
say, was instantly put in operation, and an effort to bring the mur- 
derer to punishment, with the assistance of some of the Good Citizens 
of Texas, resulted, in an agreement with the Indians, that the matter 
should be promptly submitted to the authorities of the Grovemment 
of Texas, with the assurance, that your Government would cause 
the offender to be arrested, and brought to a speedy trial. And this 
is the object of the communication now made to you. 

You are aware, that it is at vast expense and trouble, the Grovem- 
ment of the United States, assiduously endeavours to maintain 
relations of peace and amity with the Indians Tribes, guarding not 
only their own, but oftimes extending that guard, to the frontiers 
of Texas, and protecting as far as they can, all white Settlements 
along those extensive frontiers from the out breaks and incursions of 
the Indians. 

In the discharge of this humane and necessary duty, the experience 
of many years has convinced the Government of the United States, 
that most of the evils resulting to our western and border setlers, 
from ^'Indian outrage", is brought upon the white People, by their 
cruel and wicked practice, of retailing Sperituous Liquors to the 
Indians. And the Government of the United States, will use its 
best endeavours, and beseeches the aid and assistance of the Gov- 
ernment of Texas, in suppressing a traffic, so detrimental to the peace 
and safety of the western and border setlers, of both countries. 

That the joint efforts of both governments, to suppress the sale of 
sperituous Liquors by the citizens of either country, to the Indians, 
will produce the most beneficial results, there can be little doubt — 
and their mutual efforts, to punish all crimes committed against the 
Persons, or property of the border tribes, being a christian, as well as 
a national duty, if persevered in, with good faith, will restore to our 
fellow citizens a greater security, than they have heretofore enjoyed. 

That this is a desideratum greatly desired by the Grovemment of 
Texas, I can have no doubt, and, that you will take the earliest steps, 
effectually to bring Mr. Albon to punishment, if guilty, I will not 
permit myself to question. Whatever other, or further information

Jones to Van Zandt. 

Department op State 
Washington [Texas] Deer, 13th 1843 
Hon Isaac Van Zandt 

Charge cP Affaires of Texas 
etc etc etc 
Sir, 

Your two communications of the 16th Oct. and 4th Novr Ulto. 
have been recieved at this Department. The absence of His Excel- 
lency the President from the Seat of Government untill the time of 
the meeting of Congress and his various engagements since his return 
consequent upon the assembling of the Representatives of the people 
have prevented an earUer reply. 

The question of the annexation of Texas presented in the note of 
the Hon. A. P. Upshur, Secretary of State of the United States, has 
engaged the most anxious attention of the President, and 1 am spe- 
cially directed by him to communicate to you the following as the 
result of his deliberations on this subject, for your governance in 
making a reply to the note above refered to. 

The interposition of foreign friendly governments, by which an 
Armistice has been established between Texas and Mexico, and the 
prospect of a permanent peace with that power given, has been 
extended by the particular governments, mostly influential in obtain- 
ing these most desireable results chiefly with a view that in the event 
of Mexico's agreeing to acknowledge the independence of Texas she 
should continue to exist, as a separate and independent nation The 
great object and desire of Texas is the establishment of a permanent 
and satisfactory peace with her enemy, and for this purpose the good 
offices of these powers has been asked and obtained, and the object 
sought for, through their intervention appears now on the eve of 
being reaUzed. This intervention and these good offices have been 
gratuitously and unconditionally given, and although Texas is en- 
tirely free to pursue any course she may please in future, the president 
thinks that in the present state of our foreign relations, it would not 
be politic to abandon the expectations which now exist of a speedy 
settlement of our difficulties with Mexico, through the good offices of 
other powers for the very uncertain prospect of annexation to the 
United States however desirable that event, if it could be consum-

mated; might be. Were Texas to agree to a treaty of aimexation, the 
good offices of these powers would it is believed be immediately with- 
drawn, and were the Treaty then to Fail of ratification by the Senate 
of the United States, Texas would be placed in a much worse situation 
than she is at present, nor could she again ask or hope for any inter- 
position in her behalf, either by England or France — and with our 
consequent supposed dependence upon the United States might again 
return the apathy and indifference towards us which has always untill 
now characterized that government. Texas would then be left, in 
the same situation she was two years since without a friend and her 
difficulties with Mexico unsettled. 

This government is duly sensible, of the very friendly feeling 
evinced by the President of the United States in the offer to conclude 
a treaty for the annexation of this country, but from all the infor- 
mation which he has been able to obtain in relation to the views and 
feelings of the people of the United States he is induced to believe 
that its approval by the other branches of that government, would 
be, if not refused, at least of very uncertain attainment. At this 
particular time, therefore, and untill such an expression of their opin- 
ions can be obtained as would render this measure certain of success 
the President deems it most proper and most advantageous to the 
interests of this country, to decline the proposition for concluding a 
treaty. In making a communication of this determination to the 
government of the U States it will be proper to inform that govern- 
ment, that whenever the Congress or Senate of the United States 
shall throw wide open the door to annexation by a resolution author- 
izing the President of that Country to propose a treaty for the pur- 
pose, the proposition will be immediately submitted to the Repre- 
sentatives of the people of this country, and promptly responded to 
on the part of its government. 

The present determination of the President on this subject, does not 
proceed from any change in his views of the general poUcy of the 
measure but from a change in the relations of this country with other 
powers. 

Mem. consul's commission for Mobile.'* 

The amendment made to the Treaty negotiated by Mr. Riley, in 
the Senate of the United States, viz. the striking out the 4th and 5th 
Articles, renders the Treaty unacceptable to this government, conse- 
quently it will not be ratified in that shape by Texas. It is however, 
quite desireable that a treaty should be established between the two 
countries as the events of the last year have most abundantly shown. 
As it will be impossible perhaps to obtain for the present a more 
favorable arrangement than the one negotiated by Mr. Riley you

will use every proper eflfort in your power to obtain a reconsideration 
of the vote of the Senate rejecting the 4th and 5th Articles, and 
endeavor to procure a ratification of the treaty, either in the modified 
form proposed by the Senate of Texas (which is the more desirable 
one) or this failing in the form originally agreed upon between the 
contracting parties. 

As it is anticipated objections may still exist in the minds of the 
northern Senators particularly, on this subject, it may be well to call 
to your assistance some individual from that section of the coimtry, 
who from his knowledge of the interests of the people there and 
acquaintance with the individuals in question, might be able to 
remove those objections I know of no person, in such an event more 
likely to be serviceable than our present Consul for the port of New 
York. Should a state of things arise therefore, in connexion with the 
action of the Senate upon this treaty, which would appear to render 
it desirable, you will request him to visit Washington for the purpose 
above refered to The commercial and general intelligence of Mr. 
Brower his high standing and respectability as a Merchant, and his 
intimate acquaintance with all that concerns our trade with the 
United States, point him out as a most suitable person to act with you 
in the attainment of this important object. I have instituted 
careful enquiries in relation to the conduct of our Consul at New York, 
in the affair complained of by Mr. F. Wood and am satisfied that the 
conduct of that functionary in this instance, as in every other con- 
nected with the discharge of his official duties, was justifiable and 
proper, and that the charges brought against him by Mr. Wood were 
both unfounded and malicious. I shall at an early day and so soon 
as leisure permits address a communication directly to Mr. Brower, on 
this and other subjects In the mean time, I feel it my duty to say 
that the government of Texas has never had an officer, who has dis- 
charged his duties more ably, faithfully and satisfactorily than Mr. 
Brower. 

You will please conmnmicate a copy of the above to that gentleman. 

Your sending Mr. Raymond as bearer of dispatches meets the appro- 
bation of the President. His presence here at this jimcture of affairs 
gives hinri an opportunity of obtaining much valuable information, 
connected with our public interests, which he will comunicate to you 
on his return. Tlie Department is satisfied of the very able and 
faithful manner in which he has performed the duties of his office. 
His stay at the Court of Washington will probably depend upon the 
contingency of an appropriation by Congress for his salary. I refer 
you to him for much of importance which it is unnecessary I should 
write. 

In relation to the outrage committed on Mr. Bourland, I would 
observe in reply to the remarks in your last, and in addition to what 
I have heretofore said that the order for the release of the goods was

only conditional, and as the opportunity was not afforded of com- 
plying with those conditions by the forcible recapture of the goods, the 
gdvemment of the United States can have no right to claim the goods 
by virtue of that order or to refuse payment for them in consequence 
of its having been given. It appears to me that the participation of 
the officer Col. Loomis in this affair is virtually admitted by the 
United States government. 

Enclosed herewith I send you the Commission of" Esq. as Consul 
for Mobile which together with his Exequatmr when obtained you 
will please transmit to that gentleman. 

By information recieved at various times from Mexico, this gov- 
ernment is advised that Gen Waddy Thompson U. S. Minister to that 
Court, has on different occasions made assertions of an unwarrantable 
nature, and derogatory to the character of the President of this 
Republic, charging upon him the crime of having endeavored to pro- 
cure the destruction of the prisoners captiu'ed at Mier in December 
last. Untill recently these accounts were deemed of a character too 
monstrous for belief, and although for many months past, the 
journals of this country and the United States have reiterated a 
charge of this kind, the President would not have deemed the matter 
of a sufficiently authentic character to demand a serious notice, had 
not letters of Gen. Thompson to Mr. Doyle H. B. M. Charg6 d' Affaires 
at Mexico, recently published appeared to confirm the fact that Gen. 
Thompson had authorized such a statement. 

The President therefore directs that you will bring this matter 
properly before the Government of the United States and respect- 
fully request that they will institute an enquiry into the matter with 
a view of rendering justice, to the President of the Republic of Texas, 
(whose private character has been most wrongfully assailed,) in 
accordance with the friendly relations which should exist between the 
two coimtries. ♦ ♦ ♦ *

Legation op Texas 
Washington [City] Jany 2nd 1844 
Hon Anson Jones 

' etc etc etc 
Sir 

Since the date of my last despatch I have repeatedly urged upon 
the Secretary of State of the United States as well as the President 
the necessity of giving to the several complaints which we have made 
against this Government a prompt and immediate consideration. 
The Secretary of State has at all times manifested an ardent desire 
to at once take the necessary steps to accord to Texas a proper satis- 
faction. He has frequently stated to me his concurence in the opinion 
that the acts of Capt Cook were highly censureable and unjustifiable 
and of his wish to disclaim them on the part of his Government. The 
difficulty exists with the President who says that he has not been 
able to satisfy himself in regard to this as well as the circumstanoes 
in relation to the outrage upon Col Bourland and the obligation the 
United States is under to surrender Dr Robinsons negroes. Li the 
early part of the last week I called upon the President and also the 
Secretary of State and stated to them that a longer delay in regard 
to these several matters could not fail to be considered as evidence of 
a disposition upon the part of the Government of the United States 
to ward them off. Each disclaimed any such intention and said I 
should receive a note explanatory of the causes of the delay. On last 
Saturday I received the note of Mr Upsher a copy of which is herewith

inclosed. To me it is far from being satisfactory and I had designed 
to have another interview with that gentleman before I closed my 
despatch, but when I called at the State Department on today I learned 
he was very unwell and unable to attend to business. I then saw the 
President and told him I considered the note of Mr Upsher as calcu- 
lated to strengthen the idea of a wish on the part of the United States 
Government to prolong their action and treat the subject lightly, that 
such an impression was to be regreted that the complaints were not 
made as matters of form but that we must insist on their being met 
and I hoped without unnecessary delay, that six months had near 
elapsed since the principle act was commited and thatlmust be excused 
for saying to him I thought the time sufficient The President replied 
that he looked upon them himself as important and for that reason 
he was desirous to examine them fully, but that he would again assure 
me he had not the slightest disposition to evade them but felt a sincere 
desire to do full justice to Texas and that without unnecessary delay. 
Thus I have given you the situation of these several matters as they 
have progressed In regard to the letter of Genl Gains the Secretary 
of War showed me the orders of his department to Genl Scott in rela- 
tion to it in which he directs the orders to be countermanded and 
says that it was not only written without authority but in violation 
of the known wishes of the War Department Genl Gains is here and 
I am told is quite sore upon the subject I have been introduced to 
him and we have had some conversation but his letter was not alluded 
to by either of us. 

I shall not reply to Mr Upshers note at present but await this and 
the ensuing week and if by that time a further answer is not received 
from him I shall answer his note and reiterate explicitly the demands 
for reperation as contained in your instructions upon these several 
subjects. After the apparant candid averments of the President and 
Secretary of State that they have no disposition to ward off these mat- 
ters it would perhaps be uncharitable to charge the contrary Yet I 
believe that no harm will result from addressing the Secretary of State 
more energetically if they are suffered to pass over until the time 
before alluded to In connexion with this subject I saw stated in the 
newspaper that Mr Webster had indicated to Genl Almonte that by 
the permission of the Mexican Government this Government would 
furnish an escort to the Santa F6 traders beyond the boimdary of the 
United States and that Almonte replied that he had no authority to 
give the permission I called upon the President Secretary of State 
and Secretary of War and asked the grounds for the rumor In the 
War Department I was shown a statement of the case which fully 
sustained the publication. I then told the President and Secretary 
of State and War that in the name of my Government I should protest 
against all such propositions, that Mexico had no power to authorise^

such a movement that the territory over which the route passed 
belonged to Texas and that any movement of the character alluded 
to would be held as a violation of her rights Each ol the Gentlemen 
disclaimed any intention on the part of the (Jovemment of the United 
States to interfere with the territory of Texas or the contest of boun- 
dary between Texas and Mexico I likewise had understood that Capt 
Cook after the capture of Col Snivelys command had continued his 
march to Santa F6. This was denied by the Secretary of War who 
assured me that Capt Cook had been expresly ordered not to go beyond 
the boundary of the United States 

I have looked for some time with great anxiety for the receipt of 
your reply to my communications upon the subject of annexation. 
Though the measure has been carefully avoided in Congress by both 
friends and opponents yet it is decidedly the question of the day, I 
have said to the President as well as Mr Upsher that it matters not 
what may be the nature of your reply I was satisfied that we could 
not accede to their proposition imtiU proper satisfaction had been 
accorded to us in the several matters of complaint which we have 
made against the Grovemment of the United States This declara- 
tion I think will spur them up and force them to an action they 
might otherwise be. disposed to evade. 

The two Houses of (ingress are doing but little. The discussions 
have been principally upon points of order and the propriety of 
receiving aboUtion petitions The latter being the old hobby of 
Mr Adams. 

The appointments of Messrs Upshur and Nelson were yesterday 
confirmed by the Senate 

I have been endeavoring to urge upon members of Congress the 
the propriety of repealing the duty upon our cotton Mr Slidell of 
Louisiana has introduced a bill for that purpose and I have strong 
hopes of its passage If this can be effected we will thereby secure 
the principle advantages embraced in the late treaty without giving 
the important equivalents therein conceded. Mr Argaiz the Spanish 
Minister yesterday presented his letter of recall and will soon depart 
for Europe His recall is on accoimt of the late changes in the Gov- 
ernment of Spain 

Since the meeting of Congress I have left Alexandria and taken a 
house in this City near the War Department on Perm Av 

With great regard Most Respectfully

Legation of Texas 
Washington [City] 20th. January 1844 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 
Sir 

Mr. Raymond reached here on the 13th. inst., by whom I had the 
honor to receive your communication of the 13th. ultimo, the con- 
tents of which have engaged my most serious and imdivided attention, 
When I had the honor to enclose you the note of the Hon A. P. 
Upshur, Secretary of State, submitting the proposition for annexation, 
it was impossible to speak with any great degree of certainty of the 
amount of support which such a treaty, if concluded, would receive 
in the Senate of the United States. Since that time the question has 
been discussed to some extent by most of the political presses of the 
country. Congress has assembled and an opportunity has been 
afforded to ascertain the individual views of many Senators. I have 
endeavoured to avail myself of these and every other means in my 
power, in order to the formation of a correct opinion as to the probable 
success of the measure should it be attempted. Deeply impressed 
with the importance of the suggestions contained in your dispatch, 
since its receipt I have attempted, with the aid of several distin- 
guished gentlemen in and out of Congress to reinvestigate and review 
the whole case as it is presented here. The result of these investiga- 
tions has determined [me] to withhold, until I can communicate with 
your department again, the reply indicated in your communication 
declining the proposition of the Government of the United States. 
In doing this I feel assured that the great interests of the coimtry,

as well as the views and wishes of the President and people of Texas 
will be best promoted and subserved; confidently relying at the same 
time that my course in this instance will find a justification in your 
enlightened judgment. 

The President of the United States, believing that the annexation 
of a foreign state or territory to this Union should most properly be 
done by treaty, precedents having already been established in the 
cases of the acquisition of Louisiana and Florida, and a proposition 
to that effect having already been submitted by his direction, con- 
sidered it not only useless but improper to recommend to Congress 
any action at present in regard to it. The fact that the proposition 
has been made has likewise been communicated by the Secretary of 
State to many of the leading members of both Houses, which, in con- 
nection with the universally conceded opinion that the measure 
should be presented in the form of a treaty, has prevented any action 
whatever in either branch of Congress on the subject. A resolution, 
authorizing the President to enter upon any negociation whatever, 
has never been attempted, unless in such cases where he had declined 
or neglected to act. To instruct him to do that which he had already 
done would not only be useless but imcalled for. Such are the opin- 
ions of every prominent member of either House with whom I have 
conversed, as well as other distinguished gentlemen out of Congress 
who are advocates of annexation, amongst whom I "will name Mr. 
Justice Catron of the Supreme Court, whose opinions I have no doubt 
will be appreciated by His Excellency the President. From these 
facts and opinions I am satisfied that if annexation be ever attempted, 
it must be first by a treaty. 

I proceed now to state some of the evidences which impress me 
with the conviction that if a treaty is concluded, it will be ratified. 
Mr. Tyler having withdrawn from the contest for Presidency the ques- 
tion neither is, nor will be considered in reference to him, but being 
supported by both whigs and democrats will not be determined as a 
party measure, but as a great national one, alike interesting to the 
whole Union. The impressions, which exist here in regard to the 
State of Affairs, have induced the opinion that Texas must either 
be annexed to this Union, or become in some form or other a depend- 
ency of Great Britain. This view of the case has had an important 
influence upon many of the Senators of the non-slaveholding states. 
Were the question deprived of this feature I should dispair of its 
success. It is believed that any undue influence, obtained by Great 
Britain whether in a commercial or other point of view, in Texas, 
must sooner or later prove dangerous to the institutions and pros- 
perity of this country and therefore ought to be resisted. I deem 
it unnecessary to capitulate the many reasons that have been urged 
here to show that this would be the effect. This subject I believe

CORBESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 241 

is well understood and fully comprehended by both northern and 
southern men. It is also believed that Oreat Britain is now using 
every means to accomplish these purposes, and that the only security 
against her insidious poUcy is through annexation. 

In looking to the Senate to see who can be relied upon to sustain 
the measure, from all the information which I have derived, I give 
the following as my decided opinion. There is but Uttle doubt in 
the minds of many that Mr. Clay will be elected to the Presidency. 
Some of his particular friends, viz. the Senators from Kentucky, 
together with Messrs Archer and Mangum, in prospect of that event 
prefer the measure postponed in order that Afr. Clay may have the 
credit of eflfecting it, but at the same time, if the treaty be now made, 
will support it beyond doubt. Premising this I feel confident that 
we may rely upon the entire vote of the south and west, regardless 
of party, while at the north we may calculate on the whole demo- 
cratic vote, and many say Mr. Tallmadge of the Whig party, though 
the latter may be considered doubtful. If I am correct then in my 
opinions a treaty might be submitted with a confident prospect of 
its ratification. Believing then that a treaty is the proper mode, 
that public sentiment is ready for action, that the feelings already 
arroused should not be suffered to waste themselves on uncertain 
or coUatteral issues, and that by delay we should hazard the accom- 
plishment of this great measure, I deem it my duty to resubmit the 
matter to your department for the determination of the President. 

Should any other legislative action be attempted, one of the 
greatest arguments which would be relied on by the opponents of 
the measure would be that the Gk) vemment of Texas has not evinced a 
willingness to be annexed, and that any movement of Congress would 
be improper xmtil this fact is known. Under my present instructions 
I could give no assurance that the Government of Texas would agree 
to annexation, even were a law passed to that effect. A vote upon 
a resolution of this character* would not be a fair test, for all those 
who would vote for a treaty were it presented but desired to delay 
the measiu'e, would vote against siich a resolution. 

The question presents itself in another point of view, suppose that 
the. treaty if made should fail, yet the terms on which Texas is 
willing to be admitted having already been agreed upon, the data 
would thereby be given upon which to frame a bill. Such a bill, 
incorporating the provissions of the treaty for the admission of Texas 
into the Union, it is the opinion of many members, may be consti- 
tutionally passed into a law by a simple majority of both Houses of 
Congress, but without a basis previously agreed upon it would be 
imp>ossible to take any action. If this view of the constitutional

question be correct the success of the measure would be placed 
beyond the shadow of a doubt. 

I respectfully submit it as my settled conviction that Mexico does 
not now contemplate the free acknowledgment of the independence 
of Texas, nor will she grant it at this time, without such concessions 
as Texas will not make. England would doubtless oppose annexa- 
tion, but on the other hand she will never force or compel Mexico to 
acknowledge our independence without some boon from Texas, which 
cannot be granted. It is a well ascertained fact in my mind that the 
present armistice does not proceed from any disposition on the part 
of Mexico to agree to the independence of Texas. 

If in resorting to annexation, Great Britain desert us during its 
pendency, the fact of concluding the treaty will organize a party in 
this coxmtry that will neither permit us to be attacked nor cease its 
powerful support until annexation shall be effected. 

I am authorized by the Secretary of State, who speaks by the 
authority of the President of the United States, to say to you that 
the moment a treaty of annexation shall be signed a large naval 
force will be assembled in the Gulf of Mexico, upon the coast of 
Texas, and that a sufficient number of the Military force will be 
ordered to rendezvous upon the borders of Texas, ready to act as 
circumstances may require; and that these assurances will be officially 
given preliminary to the signing of the treaty, if desired by the 
Government of Texas; and that this Government will say to Mexico 
that she must in no wise disturb or molest Texas. 

Believing that in the decission of this question the destinies of 
our land are suspended,. I should be recreant to my duty did I not 
again present to you these facts and reflections that they may be 
submitted to the President, who under the guidance of Him, who 
directs the destinies of mankind, I trust will decide upon them 
in such manner as shall receive the welfare of our common country. 

That portion of your communication respecting the imprecedented 
and remarkable conduct of Genl. Waddy Thompson towards the 
President I have verbally communicated both to the President of 
the United States and Secretary of State, and had intended to 
make a communication on the subject to the State Department, 
but on further reflection I am not satisfied in my own mind whether 
imder the circumstances it would be best to do so. The President 
and Secretary of State both informed me that General Thompson 
had resigned and his resignation been accepted, and that he is 
looked for here in a few days. I will continue to think of the matter 
and take any steps which may seem proper and necessary. In the 
mean time if it is desired by His Excellency the President that I 
shall make the communication before indicated, you will write me, 
and your instructions shall be immediately complyed with. 

The treaty concluded by Mr. Reily has not been taken up with 
a view to a reconsideration of the amendments, nor do I believe it

will be possible to pass it in the original form at present, although 
I have reason to believe that the vote would be stronger for it than 
at the last session. One of the most formidable objections urged 
against its ratification was, that owing to our internal difficulties 
and the dangers which attended us from without, the belief of the 
possibiUty that Texas might become subject to some other foreign 
power was induced, and that if the navigation of the Red River 
and the Mississippi was conceded the benefits might enure to others 
through Texas. Though proceeding from a different state of [the] 
case the objection still exists in as strong form as at the last session. 
It \s alleged, as stated in a former part of this dispatch, and many 
believe it true, that England is about to obtain an undue influence 
in Texas, and these privileges of navigation if granted to Texas 
might be made the source of annoyance to the United States. That 
portion of the Southern Senators who opposed the treaty I think 
might now go for it if an action was taken, but yet these same gentle- 
men are averse to moving in the matter so long as there is a prospect 
of annexation. Place these two measures before the senate when 
you will and annexation will receive the greater number of votes. 

Mr. SUdell of Louisiana has introduced a bill to admit our cotton 
free of duty, and I have strong hopes of its passage. The only 
reason that will operate with much force to defeat it, is, that it is a 
part of the general 'tariff act, which many are opposed to disturbing. 
Mr. Archer told me last night in a long conversation I had with him, 
that the bill if it could pass the House, would pass the Senate without 
difficulty. 

For the present I do not think it necessary to require the services 
of Mr. Brower, when I have received your answer or even before 
if it appear important I will inform him of the fact. 

I have the honor to enclose you herewith a copy of a communication 
from Mr. Upshur, Secretary of State, upon the subject of the dis- 
arming of Major Snively. I have not had time to reply to it. I will 
do so as early as possible and notice the other causes of complaint 
in a more specific manner. 

Knowing that the Archives of the Government are at Austin I 
have sent you a copy of the former instructions on the subject of 
annexation, so that if the President should think proper to make 
the treaty they may facilitate in drawing any new instructions for 
the governance of your Represei^tative here. 

I have informed the Secretary of State verbally of the views of 
the President as to the formation of a treaty of annexation as indicated 
in your dispatch. 

With sentiments of high regard I have the honor to be most

Upshub to Van Zandt. 

Sm, — ^When I had the honor to address you on the 29th. ult relative 
to the outrage alledged by you to have been conunitted by Captain 
Cooke of the army of the United States in disarming a Texan force 
under the command of Colonel Snively, I could do no more than 
give you a general assurance of the regret felt by the President that 
any cause of complaint should exist on the part of Texas against this 
(Jovemment, and of the readiness of this Government to repair any 
wrong done by its forces to the dignity of Texas or the rights of her 
people. The pressure of other duties, particularly since the session 
of Congress, has rendered it impossible to give to your letter upon 
this subject the attention which it would otherwise have received. 
I have now the honor to communicate the views at present enter- 
tained by this (Jovemment, and to invite from you any further sug- 
gestions which you may think necessary to elucidate the subject. 

From the statements made to this Government, the following 
appear to be the facte of the case. On the 15th. of March, last, an 
application was made by several American citizens to the Depart- 
ment of War for an escort from Missouri to Santa Fe in Mexico. On 
the 17th. of the same month General Almonte, the Mexican Minister, 
addressed a note to the Secretary of State, desiring a similar escort 
for certain Mexican merchants then in Missouri, wBo desired to trans- 
port a large amount of goods which they had purchased, to Santa Fe. 
On the 28th. of that month, directions were issued to the War Depart- 
ment to have the escort organized for the purpose of protecting such 
of the citizens of the Republic of Mexico and of the United States as 
should be desirous of availing themselves of the same. The escort 
was to proceed as far as the territory of the United States extended 
on the route to Santa Fe. Some subsequent correspondence took 
place, but it did not alter the purposes of the escort or the extent to 
which it was to proceed. 

Captain Cooke of the Dragoons was detailed for this duty and a 
force of about one hundred and ninety men was placed imder his 
command to carry out the orders of the Department. They rendez- 
voused at Council Grove, Neosho River on the 3rd. of Jime, and pro- 
ceeded on their route with the Caravan of traders. 

On the 22nd. of Jime, Captain Cooke states, that when at Walnut 
Creek, he received intelligence th^t Colonel Snively, having about 
one hundred and eighty Texians imder his command, had avowed his 
intention to attack the caravan wherever he could find it unprotected, 
and had also made many threats against the American portion of it, 
and that three of their spies had been reconnoitering in the territory 
of the United States, and had returned on seeing his command. He 
however proceeded with the escort and caravan in the direction of a

crossing, and on the 30th. of June he saw three horsemen about a 
mile in advance, whom he supposed to be those spies, and in pursuing 
them, came in sight of the Arkansas river, on the opposite side of 
which, he saw in a large grove, a force of men and horses. They 
hung out a white flag, and he sent a subaltern with a trumpeter and 
flag to ford the river to their camp. He directed him to demand of 
the commander who they were and what they did there, and to give 
such commander or another safe conduct over to him and back. On 
his return. Colonel Snively and another officer, his aid, accompanied 
him, when Captain Cooke informed him that his people were in the 
United States, and desired to know who they were, and if he had a 
commission ? to which Col. Snively repUed that he had a Texan vol- 
unteer force of 107 men, 75 having lately returned to Texas, that he 
beUeved he was on the territory of that EepubUc and that he had a 
commission which he exhibited, and a copy of which accompanies 
Captain Cooke's communication. 

That document is not in the form of a commission, but of an order 
signed by the Acting Secretary of War and Marine, and authorized 
the raising of a partisan force without expense to the (Jovemment; 
the object of which was to retaliate and make reclamation for injuries 
sustained by Texian citizens, and declaring that the merchandize and 
all other property of all Mexican citizens would be lawful prize. Such 
as might be captured, to be brought into Red River, one half of it to 
be deposited in the Custom House of that District, subject to the 
order of the Government, the other half to belong to the captors, and 
be equally divided between the officers and men. The force was to 
operate in any portion of the territory of Texas above the line of 
settlements and between the Rio del Norte and the boundary line of 
the United States, but would be careful not to infringe upon the ter- 
ritory of that Government. Captain Cooke about this time observed 
some twelve or fifteen men crossing from the north to the south side 
and proceeding to the Texian Camp. The land on the north side of 
the Arkansas River was confessedly in the territory of the United 
States. Captain Cooke states that he believed the ground on which 
the Texians were encamped was within the territory of the United 
States also; that the line, it is true, had not been run from Red 
River to the Arkansas, but that it was understood by all to strike 
the latter river at least fifteen miles above the point where they were, 
while some believed the line to be as high up as Chouteau Island, 
sixty or seventy miles above the Caches,* or seventy five or eighty 
miles above the Texian Camp. That he then disarmed the force,

selves; the residue prefering to return to Texas were furnished with 
ten rifles and with provissions, of which they said they stood very 
much in need. 

Captain Cooke justifies his conduct, on the grounds that he found 
this force within the territory of the United States, engaged in the 
attempt to interrupt the lawful trade between the United States and 
Mexico, and that he had the right to disarm, so as to take from them 
the power of molesting our own citizens and those of Mexico engaged 
in that trade; that he used no harshness, nor more force than was 
necessary to accomplish the object. 

Colonel Snively on the other hand alleges that he was on theTexian 
territory; that he was not fairly dealt with, and that he was deceived 
under a flag of truce to place himself in Captain Cooke's power; 
that being disarmed, he was exposed to danger and to the actual loss 
of some of his men in passing through the hostile bands of Indians 
on his return to Texas, in consequence of the want of those arms. 
It further appears from the diary of Captain Cooke, that the transac- 
tion took place in the 94th degree of west longitude, as ascertained 
by actual observations, on which he rehes. 

If the facts be as here stated, the conduct of Captain Cooke, 
although it may not have been proper or justifiable, was not such as 
to merit the severe reprobation which it has received. There is 
every reason to believe that the force of Colonel Snively was actually 
within the territory of the United States. It was the duty of Cap- 
tain Cooke to protect the traders, both Mexican and American, 
throughout the whole extent of our territory. The least that can 
be said of it is, that there was no proof, and no strong reason to 
believe that the place was within the territory of Texas. So long as 
the territorial jurisdiction was doubtful, both parties had an equal 
right to be there; and although the imcertainty of the jurisdiction 
might have justified the Texan forces in attacking an enemy's force 
foimd there, the same consideration made it the duty of Captain 
Cooke to extend his protection to the caravan committed to his 
charge. Each party acted upon its own responsibihty and was 
bound for all consequences. So far, therefore, as the mere question 
of territori&l jurisdiction is concerned, neither party can have any 
assured groimd of complaint, until the fact shall be ascertained. 
In the mean time it would seem to be enough that each Government 
should disclaim any intention to violate the territory of the other; 
and that disclaimer I now make, in the fullest manner, on the part 
of this Grovemment. 

The only question, then, which can now be decided, respects the 
manner [in] which Captain Cooke discharged the duty of protecting 
the caravan of traders. In disarming the force of Colonel Snively, 
he acted without specific instructions from this Grovemment, nor had

he, any instructions which would authorize him to violate any right 
of Texas or of her people. Neither will he be held justified in exe- 
cuting a lawful authority in a harsh or unbecoming manner. I am 
directed to give this assurance to you and through you to the gov- 
enmient of Texas, in the most explicit terms. It may turn out, 
that Captain Cooke has exceeded his authority, in offering any 
hindrance whatever to the forces of Colonel Snively, or that in the 
exercise of a legitimate authority, he has gone beyond the necessity 
of the case. So far as the disarming of Colonel Snively's force is 
concerned, the probability is that it will be so found. But in the 
present uncertain state of the facts, it seems to the President that 
the Grovemment of Texas can require nothing more than the imme- 
diate institution of the requisite inquiry with a view to ascertain the 
exact state of the case. Directions have accordingly been given to 
the Secretary of War to order forthwith a Court of Inquiry upon 
Captain Cooke, and to give to the inquiry as ample a range as pos- 
siblef The arms taken from the Texan troops will be restored or 
compensation made for them. And such further steps will be taken, 
upon the report of the Court of Inquiry as may seem to be necessary, 
in order to render full justice to Texas and her people. 

In regard to the letter of Brevet Major General Gaines to Brevet- 
Brigadier General Taylor, of which you complain, I have to say that 
it is not of an official character and has not been communicated to 
any department of this Government, by the writer of it. I desire 
to assure you, however, that this government does not claim the 
right to operate beyond its own limits in time of peace; nor to vio- 
late the territory of any other power, by marching an armed force 
into it. Hence it has no difficulty in disclaiming the doctrine on 
that subject attributed to General Gaines. 

. In conclusion, Sir, I beg leave to repeat to you the assurances 
heretofore given, that this government never meditated and will 
not sanction, any indignity towards the government of Texas, nor 
any wrong towards her people; and will readily and with pleasure 
repair any injury of either kind, which may be made to appear. 
Whatever backwardness may seem to have been shown, in attend- 
ing to the complaints of Texas is to be attributed to the extreme 
pressure of the indispensable calls of duty, and not to any disinclina- 
tion to render proj>er respect to the claims of that government. 

I avail myself of this occasion, Sir, to offer you renewed assurances 
of my high consideration

Hon. Isaac Van Zandt, 

Charge d' Affaires of Texas, 

etc. etc. etc. 
Sm, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch. No. 
112, under date of the 2d. Inst., which is the only one received from 
you, at this Department, since the departure from here of Mr. Ray- 
mond. 

It is not the desire of this Government that the claim for the two 
negroes of Mr. Robertson should be any further pressed by you, at 
present. The propriety of our right to demand the restoration of 
them by the Government of the U. States is at least questionable and 
until the owner of the Slaves shall have produced satisfactory evi- 
dence, in support of his claim, the further treatment of that subject 
may be discontinued. The complaints, however, in the cases of 
Mr. Bourland and Col. Snively are of a grave and important character, 
and it is conj&dently hoped the Government of the United States will 
award prompt satisfaction and reparation for these outrages, com- 
mitted, either by or xmder the sanction of its own officers. The set- 
tlement of these difficulties would, it is believed, have a tendency to 
promote the continuance of friendly relations, as well as to ensure suc- 
cess to any negotiations which may be imdertaken between the two 
countries. 

Should you be satisfied that the door wiU be opened by the Con- 
gress of the United States, for the Annexation of Texas to that coun- 
try in the maimer referred to, in my communication of the 13th. 
Ulto. or in any manner, which may seem to ensure certain success to 
the measure, you will in that case proceed, immediately, to open the 
negotiation of a treaty for the same. The instructions referred to 
you wiU therefore consider as revoked as well as the instructions on 
the same subject of the 6th July last. The principal points for dis- 
cussion will be the poUtical character in which she shall be admitted, 
the liquidation of her pubUc debt, and the disposition to be made of 
the public domain. In reference to the first of these, you wiU require, 
that on her admission into the Union a census of her population shall 
be immediately taken by the government of the United States, and in 
the event her niunbers should be sufficient to entitle her, agreeably 
to existing laws in that coimtry, to a representation in the general 
Congress She shall in that event become, at once, entitled to existence 
as a free and sovreign State of the United States, with all the rights, 
belonging to the other members of that confederax^y, and a guarantee

for the enjoyment of all her domestic institutions. Otherwise she 
shall be admitted as a territory with similar guarantees and provisions 
for a state government, when she shall have the requisite population 

In relation to the public debt of Texas, amoimting, as it is supposed, 
to some twenty Millions of Dollars, including the unaudited claims of 
our citizens for services rendered, property furnished, and injuries 
sustained, during the war of the revolution, and for which this Gov- 
ernment is properly boimd to her citizens you will require that the 
same shall be assumed by the government of the United States, to be 
repaid to the creditors, within some fixed period, with interest not 
less than five per cent, or from time to time, so soon as the public lands 
of the Republic may be made available. It will also be necessary to 
require that in the event Texas shall be called upon to pay any por- 
tion of the public debt of Mexico, the responsibility of such payment 
shall rest upon the United States. 

In relation to the public domain of Texas, you will require that all 
claims to lands, in Texas, held by individuals or companies, for their 
own use and benefit, or for colonization shall be adjudicated and set- 
tled in the speediest manner possible, and those having legal and valid 
ones shall be entitled to receive patents to their quotas of land, and 
that all private rights to real estate, or otherwise, as they exist at the 
time of the admission of the Republic into the American Union, shall 
be, and remain inviolate. After the satisfaction of all just claims, 
the balance remaining of the public domain shall become the property 
of the United States. 

There are a great many points, of minor importance, which it would 
be necessary to provide for in a treaty of Annexation. In relation 
to these, instructions will be furnished you so soon as this government 
is advised of the fact, that the measure of annexation, is made certain 
to Texas by the action of the present Congress or Senate of the United 
States. In this event the President will also (should an appropriation 
be made for the purpose) accede to your request and send on a special 
Minister to act in conjunction with you in the arrangement of this 
important matter. In the mean time, you will ascertain the views of 
the government of the United States, so far as may be practicable, 
upon the various points submitted in this communication, and upon 
such others, connected with the subject, as may be likely to arise in 
the discussion and formation of a Treaty. 

A full power will be sent you to conclude a treaty, so soon as this 
department is advised by you of the proper action having been taken 
on this subject, by the executive and coordinate branches of the 
Govt, of the United States. 

In the event the treaty, for annexation, should not appear to have 
a fair prospect of success, you will urge upon the government of thp 
United States, in your intercourse with it, the active and efficient

interposition of its influence, in putting an end to the war with 
Mexico, and thereby ensuring to the people of both countries the 
advantages, to be derived to them, from our National Unity and 
Independence. For the more certain attainment of this desirable 
object, it would be very acceptable to this government, could a treaty 
of alliance, offensive and defensive towards Mexico be formed with 
it, by that of the United States. You will therefore sound the 
Secretary of State of the United States on this subject, and inform 
him of our willingness to enter into some arrangement of the kind, 
and inform this Department of his views, in reference to the subject, 
at the earUest possible period. The declarations, made by the 
President of the United States, in his late Annual Message to Con- 
gress, and the position taken by him, as well as the principles avowed 
by the Secretary of State of the United States, and the Minister, Gren. 
Thompson, in their late correspondence with the authorities of 
Mexico, would appear to suggest the alliance, now proposed, as the 
most proper means of giving effect to those declarations and prin- 
ciples, with the view of promoting the interests the United States 
have in the establishment of our complete independence, as con- 
nected with the commercial advantages, to be obtained, for them, 
through such a measure, the safety of their domestic institutions, and 
the continuance of Union and harmony between the different mem- 
bers of their confederacy. No proposition for a treaty of alliance has 
yet been authorized to be made to any other government, but as our 
negotiations with Mexico may be abruptly terminated, it becomes the 
duty of this Government to be prepared for such an emergency. It 
is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the views of the United 
States, on this subject, should be immediately known, and communi- 
cated by you to this Department, in order that the President, in the 
event of an unfavorable answer, might take prompt action, in refer- 
ence to it, with some other government, whose friendly dispositions 
can be relied upon. 

Upon the most mature deliberation and consultation with the 
various tribes of Indians, including the Kioways and Commanches,' 
it has been concluded to hold a General Council with them, at the 
Tahuacana Creek, on the Brazos river about 25 miles above the falls,' 
in the month of April next, at which it would be desirable to have the 
attendance of Col. Butler, on the part of the United States. So 
many objections appeared to have arisen to the Treaty being held 
on Red River as originally proposed by you that the President agreed 
to change the place of holding it as above. You will make this 
arrangement known to the Gk)vt of the United States and request the 
attendance of their Commissioner etc., at the time and place specified. 
It is presumed this alteration will not be productive of any dissatis-

faction to the Government of the U. States, or serious inconvenience 
to Col. Butler, while it is believed that by holding the Council on the 
Brazos, the tribes to be pacified will be removed as much as possible 
from all undue and adverse influences, which the cupidity and selfish- 
ness of Indians and others residing on and near Red River, might 
otherwise interpose, in endangering the success of the Treaty.

It having been determined by His Excellency the President to 
accede to a proposition which has be-en made to this government by 
that of the United States to conclude a Treaty for the annexation of 
Texas to that country, and to enter into n^otiations for that pur- 
pose at the city of Washington he has appointed you Special Agent of 
this government to conduct, in conjimction with the Hon. I. Van 
Zandt our present Charg6 d'Affaires at that Court, those negotia- 
tions. You will receive herewith your Commission, also a letter 
accrediting you in this capacity, to the Secretary of State of the 
United States and a full power to conclude and sign with such per- 
son or persons as may be appointed and similarly accredited on the 
Part of the U States a Convention or Treaty in the premises.* 

Unavoidable circumstances prevent me at this time from giving you 
ample written instructions. Such however as may be deemed neces- 
sary will be prepared and sent to you at the City of Washington in a 
very few days. In the mean time, it is only requisite for me to say 
to you that the President places great reliance upon your skill judg- 
ment and intimate knowledge of the subject and the important 
interests of the country which are involved in it, and does not deem 
it proper therefore to confine your action within the limits which 
minutely special instructions impose and thereby to hazard the 
successful issue of your mission. You will proceed to the city of 
Washington with as Uttle delay as possible, and place yourself in 
communication with Mr. Van Zandt, from whom you will learn the 
present attitude of this matter at that Court After being received 
in your official and diplomatic capacity by the government of the 
United States, you will previous to entering into the negotiation, 
take measures to obtain from that government, as full a guarantee 
as possible to the requirements of this government, as contained in 
my letter to Gen. W S. Murphy Charg6 d Affaires of the U. S. under 
date of the 14th. Inst, a copy of which is herewith enclosed for your 
information as well as his answer and my reply thereto. So soon as 
you shall have reed satisfactory assurances on the main point in that 
letter, and which you wUl see has been refered by Gen. Murphy to 
his government for that purpose you will proceed to enter upon the 
negotiations for a treaty of Annexation between the two countries. 
Untill you shall receive the instructions refered to in the commence- 
ment of this despatch you will be governed by those heretofore given 
by this government to its Ministers on this subject.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note addressed 
to this Department on the 1st December last upon the subject of an 
alledged murder of a Choctaw Indian named Daniel Wesley said to 
have been committed by a white man named George Albon at the 
Pine Bluffs. 

Upon the receipt of your note above refered to steps were imme- 
diately taken to have the cause of complaint investigated by this 
Government, with a view to inflicting proper punishment upon the 
individual charged with this outrage should it appear that he had 
been guilty of the same as well as for the purpose of preventing a 
repetition of such act on the part of any of our citizens as far as 
might be practicable, and I should sooner have answered your note 
and given you this assurance but was daily expecting your presence 
at the Seat of Government, an event which I regret the state of your 
health has untill now prevented. 

The existence of the traffic in spiritous liquors by our citizens 
with the Indians this Government most strongly deprecates and it 
will use its best endeavors at all times in conjunction with the United 
States in preventing it upon our conterminous borders. 

So soon as Mr. Albon can be arrested and brought to trial for the 
alledged offence the same will be done, and I beg leave to assure you 
that no proper efforts which this government can use will be omitted 
to cause this matter to be duly investigated and justice as well as 
prompt punishment to be inflicted upon him if found guilty

Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose you a copy of a communication 
addressed by me to Hon A. P. Upshur, Secretary of $tate of the 
United States in reply to his of the 29th. of December, last, and of 
the 16th ultimo upon the subject of the outrage committed by Captain 
Cooke under the sanction of Major General Gaines, copies of which I 
have heretofore forwarded to your department. I have given this 
subject every attention in my power, and from all that I have been 
enabled to discover it is my impression (although as you perceive I 
maintain the contrary to this Government) that the occurrence took 
place within the territory of the United States. I found in the 
Topographical oflSce, here, a map of the Santa Fe road, made from 
actual survey by order of this Government. That map shows that 
the territory where Major Snively was encamped was about or a short 
distance west of longitude 99®. What will be the result of the Court

of Inquiry of course can't be known beforehand, I have no doubt 
however that the whole transaction will be fully investigated. 

The President of the United States, from some cause, seems disposed 
(for the Secretary of State informed me that what he had said was 
altogether by His direction) to pass over if possible the letter of Gen- 
eral Gaines without exposing the orders which have been issued from 
the War Department concerning it. I think my reply will bring that 
matter out. As I stated to you on a former occasion I know the order 
of disapproval has been issued for I read the record in the War Depart- 
ment. After my communication to Mr. Upshur has been examined 
by His Excellency Genl. Houston, if any further steps be thought 
necessary I hope you will advise me as early as practicable. 

You will perceive that I have again urged the consideration of the 
complaint made in the case of the rescue of the goods from the 
Collector of Red River. A short time since in a conversation with the 
President I informed him we should require a full indemnification for 
the goods taken; he repUed, he thought we ought to bo satisfied with 
the payment of the duties if we could get that. I rejoined that we 
should expect the whole amount to be paid. I shall leave no means 
untried to get a decission of this matter as early as possible. The 
Secretary has so many engagements to attend to that it is difficult 
for him to devote much time to any particular subject. 

I also enclose you a copy of a note received by me from Mr. Upshur, 
with a letter from the Secretary of War communicating the decission 
of his Department in the case of Dr. Robertsons' negroes ; and also a 
copy of my reply. You will perceive that this long controversy has 
at length been terminated favorably. I had much difficulty with it, 
on account of the former decission made to my predecessor. Mr. 
Spencer fought against it throughout and contended for every inch 
of groimd. I deem it unnecessary to rehearse all the objections made, 
suffice it to say, they first denied the true state of the facts — ^next, the 
right to demand them under the treaty, and lastly denied the force of 
the treaty itself. AH of which I finally battled down and now have 
the satisfaction to give you the result. The negroes will be deUvered 
to Dr Robertson whenever he appUes to Gov Butler the Cherokee 
Agent. It would be well to inform him as early as possible that he 
may attend to it. 

I send you a copy of an extract of a letter from Mr. Brower on the 
subject of the proceedings of the Chamber of Commerce in regard to 
our treat3^ His effort, to secure the passage of certain resolutions 
and the adoption of a report upon the subject, it seems, has failed. 
He has since gotten up a petition on the subject which will be for- 
warded to the Senate. 

Aside from the general disposition not to agitate that matter again 
at this time, it cannot have escaped your attention that the last article

of the treaty itself says that the exchange of ratification shall take 
place within ten months, which period has sometime since expired. 
To renew the action on the treaty your Representative here will have 
necessarily to be furnished with full powers to do so, by an additional 
article. 

I sent you a few days ago a printed copy of the letter of Mr. Walker 
upon the subject of annexation, it has had a most powerful influence 
here and will have throughout the whole country. The question is 
evidently gaining friends, and great anxiety is manifested that a 
treaty should be made as early as possible. I regret to learn that a 
memorial upon annexation has been received here from all the mem- 
bers of our Congress, except four, who were reputed sick or absent. 
I have not seen the memorial or the names. The proceeding is cer- 
tainly a novel one. It is considered as having been gotten up because 
of their distrust of the Executive and has tended to confirm the many 
false rumours circulated against his reputation. The impression is, 
that all who signed the memorial show they have a want of confidence 
in the head of the nation, through whom diplomatic affairs are usually 
conducted, such certainly could not have been their design. But 
whatever it may have been, the step can add nothing to our advan- 
tage, or the elevation of that confidence so essential to every nation. 

With the highest 
sentiments of regard I have the 

honor to be

Extract of a letter from Mr. Brower Consul of Texas at New York to Mr. Van Zandt, dated January 

3l8t 1844. 

"As soon as I perceived that Mr. Slidell from the Come, of Com- 
merce, in the House of Repr. had reported a bill to admit Texian 
cotton into the U. S. free from duty, I procured an extra meeting of 
the Chamber of Comfaerce in order to take up my report on the table, 
which closes with a resolve to memorialize the U. S. Senate in favour 
of adopting, [or] rather ratifying, the Commercial Treaty negociated 
between Mr. Reily and Mr. Webster. 

The members of the Chamber of Conmierce hold diverse views in 
reference to ** ''free trade" and ''restrictive policy'' which from my 
first movement in this matter, gave me fears of opposition. I was 
opposed on three grounds. First, it was objected that any considera- 
tion was due to cotton from Texas in preference to other foreign 
cottons which might be imported into the United States. Second, 
the Chamber is operating by memorial to Congress for the establish- 
ment of a *' warehousing system'* whereby to favour importations

into this country as a transitu market, and it was objected that this 
might miUtate against that project. Finally, it was doubted whether 
your treaty could be ratified by the U. S. Senate in good faith with 
treaty stipulations between the U. S. and other coimtries. To the 
first objection, I answered, that I esteemed this a project complete 
in itself, that the nature of our trade with Texas made it necessary, 
to the preservation of that trade, that the reciprocal principles of 
the Treaty should be adopted. That the U. S. would receive bene- 
fits, from those principles, large and fully commensurate to any they 
could concede to Texas. It was for the interest of the U. S. both in 
her commerce and manufactures that the Treaty should be ratified, 
and this could not be mistaken or fairly opposed, as shown by the 
details of the report under consideration. I had no objection, if 
gentlemen wished to throw open our ports to cotton of other countries, 
to go with them on all proper occasions and to every extent of fair 
reciprocity in trade, as it never had been my belief that the ^^restric- 
tive'' was the best commercial policy of the U. S. But I did object 
to tacking to this movement any other project, not digested and 
which, at any time might be of doubtful propriety. To the second 
objection, I answered, if it could be shown in what point the ware- 
house bill was to be, or could be, prejudiced by this recommendation, 
I might find excuse for not urging my position. As appeared to me, 
we had to look to men of Uberal views, in Congress, for the carrying 
of both objects — these objects had strong analogies, and those who 
favored the one would advocate the other, while therefore, this 
might aid the ware house bill, it could not in any respect impair its 
chances. I opposed the final objection, by saying, gentlemen cannot 
for a moment suppose Mr. Webster and Mr. Reily to have overlooked 
the first principle on which a contract is based, viz, the right of the 
parties to enter into it without violating faith with existing obliga- 
tions between themselves and other parties; this was assuming too 
much. For myself, I did not doubt the U. S. had the right to grant 
particular privileges to a nation, which, as a consideration, gave 
particular and ample advantages in return. But suppose the objec- 
tion well taken, our memorial could work no evil. If the U. S. 
Senate have their hands tied by preexisting treaties, they cannot 
ratify this. We do not ask them to violate faith, but to act only so 
far as they can conformibly to it. 

I confess to you, I saw no point or force in any of the objections 
raised, but rather a narrow and iUiberal principle operating to the 
prejudice of strict propriety. But the result was I lost my object 
by the casting vote of the President of the Chamber".

Sot 

In reply to my note of the 14th. of September, last concerning 
two negroes the property of Dr J. W. Robertson of Texas which 
were captured by the Indians and are now in the possession of James 
Edwards of the Cherokee nation, I have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of your note of the 6tli. instant, witli the accompanying 
copy of a letter of the Secretary of War of the 3rd. inst, communi- 
d^hig to the Department of State the deciseion of the War Depart- 
ment upon that subject, from which it appears that orders have bemi 
given to the Cherokee Agent to deliver up the boys in accordance 
with the 33rd. Article of the treaty of 1831. 

I shall hasten to communicate to my Govemmeat information of 
this determination, that the necessary steps may be taken to receive 
the negroes refered to from the Cherokee Agent. 

The proper decission of this long standing question will afford much 
satisfaction to the Qovemmeot of Texas. While it furnishes another 
evidence of the friendly disposition of the Govenmient of the United 
States, and of its deterooination to fulfill in good faith its treaty 
stipulations, it is at the same time calculated to exercise a most 
salutary influence upon the border tribes of Indians, who have 
heretofore committed their depredations upon the defenceless settlers 
of Texas, and fled to the United States where they have found a 
market for their captives and spoils. 

The Undersigned avails himself of this occasion to offer Mr. Upshur 
renewed assurances of his distinguished consideration. —

Sm, 

I am in receipt of your despatches to the 20th. of January. 

Congress having passed a secret act and made an appropriation of 
Five thousand Dollars for the purpose of sending a special agent to 
Washington City to act in conjimction with you in negotiating a 
Treaty, for the Annexation of Texas to the United States of America, 
The President has been pleased to appoint J. Pinckney Henderson to 
that office. Gen Henderson left this place last week, with instruc- 
tions to proceed, without delay, to the city of Washington, to dis- 
charge the duties of his mission, accompanied by W. D. Miller, Esq. 
as Secretary to the secret Legation. A copy of the instructions given 
to (Jen. Henderson for the governance of both you and himself, and 
also of the correspondence between the State Department and (Jen. 
Murphy, Charg6 d' Affaires of the U States, on the subject of Annexa- 
tion as also a full power to you, in conjunction with the special agent, 
to conclude and sign a treaty in the premises, were forwarded you by 
Mr. Miller, who will probably be at Washington by the time this 
despatch is received.

Gentlemen, 

The President having duly empowered you, under circumstances 
and considerations which have already been specified to open nego- 
tiations for a Treaty of Annexation with the United States of Amer- 
ica, you will proceed in conjunction in effecting a Treaty for the same, 
taking as the basis of your action the instructions given by the Sec- 
retary of State, the Hon. S. F. Austin, to our Minister at Washington 
in 1836,** and those furnished to you respectively by myself on the 
27th of January Ulto. and 15th. of Feb. Inst.

These instructions are deemed sufficiently ample for your direction 
and upon mature reflection more minute ones are deemed unneces- 
sary. The President relies upon your intimate knowledge of the 
interests of this country and the wishes of its government to meet 
any point which may arise in the discussion of the subject with the 
authorities of the United States, and not embraced in the instruc- 
tions already given as above refered to. There are two points how- 
ever not embraced in those instructions to which your attention will 
be directed 

The first is, The number of States, into which the territory of Texas 
shall be subdivided It is presumable that in the settlements 
already made there is a sufficient population to constitute one State, 
accorcUng to the requirements of the Federal Constitution and that 
the remaining territory of the RepubUc is sufficiently large to con- 
stitute three more at a future period. You will therefore provide in 
the Treaty for the ultimate creation of at least four States, and for 
their admission into the Union, so soon as the population of the 
respective territories of which they are to be composed shall be suffi- 
cient for that purpose, — and in the mean time that territorial gov- 
ernments shall be established and maintained as circumstances and 
the wants of the people residing in those Umits respectively may 
render proper and necessary 

The second point is the disposition of the Navy of Texas In rela- 
tion to this you will provide that all the national vessels shall become 
the property of the United States and that its government shall pay 
to the builders of the vessels the price of the same agreeably to con- 
tract with a reasonable interest on the amount. 

The limits of Texas being defined by act of Congress, you will be 
governed by that act in specifying its boundaries. 
I have the honor to be 

with the highest respect

Dispatch No. 115. 

Legation op Texas 

Washington D. 0, 

March Sih. 1844 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 
Sm 

Your dispatch of the 27th of January, last, has been received and 
its contents noted. Intelligence will have reached you in advance 
of this of the deaths of Mr. Upshur, Secretary of State, and of Mr. 
Gilmer Secretary of the Navy. This lamentable dispensation of 
Providence has cast an imusual gloom over all. The loss of two such 
distinguished men at this great crisis must be severely felt — Felt not 
only by this coimtry; but our own. Both were ardent and devoted 
friends of our cause — ^ready and willing to do every thing consistent 
with the high principles of honor and patriotism, that might be 
calculated to advance our interest and promote our welfare. For 
some days previous to Mr. Upshur's death we had been engaged in 
discussing the terms of a treaty of annexation and had agreed upon 
all the main points, subject, however, to any changes which might be 
made necessary upon the receipt of further instructions from your 
Department. I had given to him for examination an outline of the 
points which would be required to be included; and he had sub- 
mitted to me a similar draft, in his own handwriting, embracing his 
views, which corresponded fully with my own in every main particu- 
lar. In this situation I was awaiting a reply to my last commimica- 
tion on this subject. Had instructions arrived to authorize me to 
consumate it, the treaty could have been concluded in half a day. 
Who may be called to the State Department is yet uncertain. I fear 
it will not again be so well filled. So far as the question of annexation 
is concerned I feel well assured no one will be appointed who will be 
so well suited to carry out the measure as Judge Upshur was. He 
had fully investigated it in all its bearings and knew the opinions, 
the prejudices, and inclinations of the Senate in regard to it. His 
great strength of intellect, his indomitable energy, nerve and decission 
of character combined with an amiable disposition that secured the 
love and respect of all parties, fitted him beyond any other man for 
this great task. 

In compliance with your last instructions I indicated to Mr. Upshur 
the desire of our Grovemment to conclude a treaty of alliance in the 
event that no assurance was given by Congress or the Senate before

hand that a treaty of annexation would be ratified. He replied that 
such a treaty could not be concluded, that it would be against the 
long settled and established policy of the United States, and that 
the only way in which this Government under present circumstances 
could become a party vnth us was by annexation, which he had pro- 
posed through the constitutional channel of the treaty making power. 
If the object contemplated by you is really to conclude a treaty of 
alliance with the President of the United States after declining to 
accept his proposition of annexation, I am at a loss to determine 
the reason of the choice of this policy. To conclude a treaty of 
alliance with the United States would give as great offence to Great 
Britain and France as a treaty of annexation, and such a treaty would 
certainly stand a less chance of ratification in the Senate of the United 
States, for it would involve this Government in all the responsi- 
bilities which annexation would, and yet secure to it none of its great 
advantages. 

Although in your instructions to me you say it is not the desire of 
our Government that the claim for thd two negroes of Dr. Robertson 
should be any further pressed by me at present, yet I have no doubt 
you will be satisfied to learn that contrary to your expectations I 
have succeeded in obtaining an order for their delivery, the particular 
circmnstances attending which are detailed in my last dispatch. 

Since writing the foregoing this morning, I have had an interview 
with the President. He informed me that on yesterday he received 
a dispatch from Genl. Murphy in which it was stated that Genl. 
Henderson had been appointed to act with me in the formation of a 
treaty of annexation, who would bring with him full powers for that 
purpose. The President stated he was very desirous to have the 
treaty concluded at once and by Mr. Nelson the Attorney General, 
who is Secretary of State adinterim, that he prefered he should do it 
instead of the gentlemen to whom he intended to offer the permanent 
appointment, and that as Mr. Upshur and myself had already com- 
menced the treaty he hoped I would proceed at once to arrange the 
matter with Mr. Nelson so that the treaty might be ready to be 
signed by General Henderson upon his arrival should it meet his 
conciurence. Having received your instructions upon the principal 
points to be embraced in the treaty and having already taken some 
steps in the matter, and believing that every delay should be avoided, 
I shall proceed to the discussion with Mr. Nelson in order that it may 
be concluded at the earliest day possible after the arrival of Genl. 
Henderson 

With the highest 
regard I have the honor to be 
Most Respectfully 

Your Obdt. Servt.

Legation op Texas 

Washington D. C, 

March 20th 18U 
Hon Anson Jones etc etc etc 

Sm Near three weeks ago Despatches were received by this Gov- 
ernment from Genl. Murphy stating that my despatches resubmiting 
the question of annexation to our Government had been received by 
you and my recommendations adopted by the President. 

On the 9th Inst Capt Tod returned here but brought me not a 
single line from- your Department nor up to the present moment have 
I any communication in reply to mine before alluded to. Letters have 
been received in Baltimore from Houston and published more than 
a week ago stating that Genl Henderson had been appointed a special 
minister and Plen. and En. Exy. to conclude a treaty of annexation 
with other particulars of an alledged secret act of Congress etc This 
information has aroused the whole opposition and who now daily 
pour forth the vials of its wrath upon the contemplated treaty Why 
all these matters should be communicated to Genl Murphy and 
otherwise made public in Texas and to be heralded throughout this 
country by the newspapers and yet I receive no information from 
your Department concerning it, is most remarkable. 

On the 19th ultimo Genl Henderscm wrote me hastily from Gal- 
veston that he was coming but did not mention the particulars. I 
have not heard of or from him since that time 

The delay which has attended the action on this matter has had an 
injurious tendency. Our friends here, in New York and else where 
urge the importance of an early action if an action is contemplated 
at aU, In a letter I received from Mr Brower last night he laments 
the delay which has occured and fears its consequences, but concludes 
by saying he ''doubts not" '4t were well done if done quickly" 

Four of the New York papers are out in favor of annexation, viz. 
The ''Herald" "The RepubUc" The "Courier and Enquirer" and the

Dear Sir 

I have just received your two communications of the 24th and 25th

Since the date of my last letter nothing of importance has tran-

nor have I received any information from him. On yesterday 1

tion together with the proper full power to act in the matter. I have 
fully discussed with the Secretary of State all the points, of the treaty, 
embraced in your instructions, and they have all been satisfactorily 
arranged ready to be submitted to Grenl. Henderson for his joint 
approval whenever he comes. I regret much his delay and begin to 
fear that some accident has befallen him. Mr. Miller waited three 
days and a half for him at Louisville, and left without hearing a word 
from him. 

A great effort is making to lay the treaty over if it is made, and if 
the action is much longer delayed the effort will succeed I fear. 

The substance of the whole negotiation has by some means become 
public, Grenl. Henderson's appointment, secret act of Congress and 
all. Letters are daily coming to persons here from Texas, the writers 
of which seem to understand the whole matter. Whom we should 
blame for this, is difficult to tell. Let it be whom it may it is never-

indicate that the Mexican government are determined not to recog- 
nize the independence of Texas I presume the apprehension of the 
annexation of this country to the U. States and the recent movements 
on this subject has had its influence with the authorities of Mexico 
in determining its present course. The President will scarcely deem 
it proper to send Commissioners to the City of Mexico, and indeed the 
time allowed them to arrive there and conclude their negotiations 
(1st of May next) renders the matter almost absolutely impracticable. 

Enclosed herewith I also send you a letter just received from Capt. 
Charles Elliot H. B. Majestys Chargfi d* Affaires to this government 
asking certain explanations of this government on the subject of 
Gen. Henderson's Mission, and the annexation of Texas to the

All the above documents are forwarded for the information of

proper to make of the same, in connexion with your negotiations for 
a treaty of annexation, the successful accomplishment of which has 
now become more desireable and necessary to the welfare of Texas 
than ever. And in connection with this subject the President directs 
me to say to you and Gen. Henderson if you are unable to conclude 
a Treaty for Annexation within the limits of the instructions already 
given by this Department you and he are in that case vested with 
discretionary powers to conclude^ said Treaty upon the best terms 
possible to be attained if in your good judgments those terms are

Sm, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch 
(No 116) under date of the 20th. Ulto. The despatches from this 
department in answer to those from you duplicates of which were 
brought by Capt Tod, were forwarded by Gen Henderson and others 
by Mr. W D. Miller, the first named gentlemen having left here 
previous to the arrival of Capt. Tod, and the latter starting in com- 
pany with him. The President having informed me that he had 
addressed you a private communication by Capt. Tod, and knowing 
no definite and conclusive action could be had by you in reference 
to the Treaty of annexation imtill the arrival of Gen. Henderson, 
and also believing that he would be with you as soon as Capt. Tod, 
I did not think it necessary to forward any despatches or duplicates 
by that Gentleman. I regret the delay of Messrs Henderson and 
Miller, (but presume it to have been in consequence of causes over 
which they had no control,) and also the State of impleasant sus- 
pense in which you have been kept in consequence of the non-recep- 
tion of my dispatches. Long before this I trust Gen. Henderson 
with Mr. Miller will have arrived at Washington, from whom as well 
as from the docimients they bore, you will have recieved such infor- 
mation as will no doubt satisfy you the Department has had no 
intention to neglect the interesting matter in which Texas and the 
United States are now engaged or anything which might ensure its 
prompt and favorable issue 

I should have written you much more at length on the occasion 
of the departure of Gen. Henderson Mr Miller and by Capt. Tod, but 
deemed it imnecessary, as the information which those (jentlemen 
could give you I presumed would be more satisfactory and more 
full than any communication which I had time to write. 

The appointment of Gen. Henderson the objects of his Mission, 
and the secret act of C!ongress in relation to the subject of annexa- 
tion, have never "been made public in Texas'' (as you appear to 
think is the case) by the authority of this (Jovemment, or com- 
municated except to those the performance of whose duties required 
they should have the information. Gen. Murphy was one in this

situation. The various statements in newspapers and the aver- 
ments of letter writers to which you allude have been wholly gra- 
tuitous and unauthorized by this Department, and although I may 
very much deplore the ill consequences which such publications and 
statements may have, they appear to be evils inseperable from the 
perfect freedom of our institutions. At least this Department 
cannot willingly be made responsible for such things. The "vials 
of the opposition" in the United States are full of wrath I presume, 
and that they will "pour them out" in good time is very probable 
and equally so whether my despatches reach you in due time or are 
delayed on the road from some casual or unavoidable circumstance 
My last despatches to you were of the dates of the 25th Feb. and

To the Hon. Anson Jones, 
Sib, 

We have the honor herewith to transmit to you, a copy of the 
treaty which we have this day signed, with Mr. Calhoun, the Secre- 
tary of State of the United States.*' We do this hastily, as this 
Government will, on Sunday, despatch an express to Texas to con- 
vey this and other important intelligence to our Government. 

The treaty we have agreed upon, you will readily see, is not pre- 
cisely such an one as we expected to make or had a right to wish. 
But, after consulting the wishes and views of all parties concerned, 
we agred to it as the best we could frame with the prospect of its 
ratification by the Senate of the United States. Had we been left 
to consult the wishes and disposition of the President and Cabinet 
of the United States, we could and would have concluded a treaty 
much more favorable to Texas than the one we have signed. But 
such was not the case. We have been compelled to consult the 
views and wishes of the two great leading parties in the United 
States — avoiding on the one hand the very liberal terms which the 
Southern politicians would have been willing to grant us and the 
restrictions which the North would wish to impose.

Texas has in this case consulted, through her agents here, as far 
as she could understand and reconcile them, the wishes of all parties 
in the United States. Upon examination, reflection and consulta- 
tion, we concluded that the best mode of our admission was as a 
Territory. Consequently; we did not hesitate to agree to come 
into the United States in that way. By the terms of the treaty, 
you will see that we have the right to claim the preservation of all 
of our property as secured by our domestic institutions as well as 
to claim admission into the Union as a state or states, under the 
provisions of the Federal constitution of the United States 

We have felt ourselves obliged to avoid any allusion, directly, 
either to slavery or boundary, leaving the one to the future nego- 
tiations of this Government, and the other to be governed by that 
clause of the treaty which secures to us the right of property, etc., 
which we imderstand to include our right to slaves, as the consti- 
tution of the United States recognizes that species of property. 
Indeed, we have, as nearly as we could, followed the language of the 
treaties ceding Louisiana and Florida to the United States, in order 
that those precedents might be referred to, to justify the language 
used in the present treaty. The manner in which our present debt 
is to be paid, too, did not entirely meet our sanction; especially as 
there is no distinction made by the treaty between debts due to 
speculators and the debts due to our own citizens, for civil, military 
and naval service, or to persons who generously furnished money 
and supplies for our army and navy when we most needed them. 
But it was deemed best to accede to the terms agreed upon, in 
order to obviate objections. The only inquiry with us was: What 
will the Senate of the United States agree to? and not, What can 
we get from the Executive of the United States ? We very much 
wished to have this Government pay the dues to our army, navy, 
civil oflBcers, etc., but we feared the consequences of such a provi- 
sion; and therefore we agreed to the terms inserted in the treaty 
on that subject. The additional excuse is, that our people will be 
in a great degree repaid by the additional security given to them 
by the contemplated annexation. 

We fear, too, that the President expected us to make better pro- 
visions for Texas on the subject of public schools, internal improve- 
ments, etc., etc; but we are sure that he would have been well satisfied 
of the impropriety of inserting any better terms, had he been present 
here. 

You will herewith receive the reply of Mr. Calhoun, made at our 
request to a note addressed by your undersigned representative, 
I. Van Zandt, to Judge Upshur, upon the subject of the assiu*ance of 
protection to Texas by the United States, during the pendency of the

treaty negotiations. We have no doubt that the President of the 
United States will act on this subject in a way that will fully meet 
the views and wishes of the President of Texas. We have strong 
a^ssurances of this. The main body of the army designed for the 
protection of Texas, we have agreed, shall be concentrated and 
stationed at Fort Jesup. Those already at Fort Towson, New Orleans, 
and other places, near Texas, will remain where they now are; and 
it is imderstood and agreed that the President of Texas shall at once 
open communications with the commanding officers at each station, 
so as to give them the earliest possible news of any hostile demonstra- 
tions on the part of Mexico. The Secretary of State of the United 
States will superintend the issuance of orders to the different officers in 
command at the several stations above alluded to; which instructions 
we are assured will be such as to meet the wishes of our Government 
fuUy.^ . 

As it is not certain that the Senate of the United States will ratify 
the treaty which we have signed, the President of the United States 
assured us, before we agreed to sign and submit it, that he would, 
immediately upon its rejection by that body, should it be so disposed 
of, send to both Houses of Congress a message, recommendiog to them, 
in the strongest terms, the passage of a law annexing Texas os a state, 
xmder that provision of the constitution of this Government, which 
authorizes Congress to admit new states into the Union. The history 
of the debates and proceedings of the convention which framed that 
constitution prove beyond doubt that Congress has such power. 
And it is confidently believed by the friends of Texas in the Congress 
of the United States, that such a law can be passed. It was imder 
this view of the case that we agreed to frame the treaty and submit 
it to the Senate of the United States, imder such doubful chances for 
its ratification by that body, believing that this course will be fully 
approved by the President of Texas. 

You will observe that we have fixed the tkne iu which the exchange 
of the ratification of the treaty is to be made, at six months, which 
will render it necessary for the Senate of the United States to act 
definitely on it during the pres^it session of Congress, and not leave 
them at liberty to delay that action until next winter, which many of 
the Senators wish to do, and probably would do, if the time given by 
the treaty permitted it. We would respectfully suggest to you and 
through you to the President, the propriety of delaying any action on 
the part of our Senate, imtil after the treaty shall have been ratified 
on the part of the Senate of the United State, as there is some doubt 
of its ratification here. 

The assurance has been given to us by Mr. Calhoim, verbally, 
which we reduced to writing in his presence and by his consent and

then read them [sic] over to him. They are as follows, to'witl 
A powerful naval force, to consist of ten or twelve vessels, will be 
ordered to the gulf of Mexico, the commander of which, Capt. Conner,^ 
will, upon any serious demonstration being made by water by Mexico 
against Texas, inform the Mexican commander that any attack upon 
Texas will be considered as a hostile act, and the Executive will feel 
himself bound to use every means to repel it — that the old division 
as established by Mr. Calhoun as Secretary of War, extending from 
Florida Point to the Southern extremity of Lake Michigan, has been 
restored, and (Jen. Gaines been put in command of the Western Divi- 
sion and ordered to take up his head quarters at Fort Jesup, who will 
receive similar orders as to any demonstration by land, to those given 
to the naval commander as to a demonstration by sea, and that he and 
the Chargfi d'Aflfaires will keep up an active correspondence with the 
President of Texas ; and if they should receive any communication from 
him, which he conceives threatens any serious intention upon the 
part of Mexico to invade Texas by land, they or either of them shall 
forthwith despatch the same to Washington City, by express — that 
the President will in that event send a message to Congress, informing 
them of the fact, and request Congress to adopt, as speedly as possible, 
such measures as may be necessary for the defence of Texas; and if 
the emergency should require it, to say in his message that he would in 
the meantime consider it his duty to defend Texas against aggression, 
and will accordingly do so. 

In addition to the above, we received the accompanying answer 
from Mr. Calhoun to the communication above alluded to; which is 
communicated confidentially. 

Mr. Calhoun expressed to us the wish of the President of the United 
States, that we should inform the President of Texas that it is his 
desire that Texas shall herself repel any light attempt on the part of 
Mexico to make war upon her frontier, and not call on the United 
States to render the promised aid unless the demonstration made by 
Mexico should be such as Texas could not easily repel. This we 
promised to do, and at the same time assured Mr. Calhoun, that the 
wishes of the President of the United States would be complied with 
by the President of Texas. 

Much more passed between Mr. Calhoim and ourselves on this sub- 
ject, calculated to assure us that everything would be done hy the 
United States to protect Texas from the aggressions of Mexico, but 
which we cannot now mention. 

Gen. Gaines will soon be at Fort Jesup, ready to receive any intel- 
ligence which the President of Texas may have to communicate in 
regard to the movements of Mexico, and to move into Texas at any

read the note of Mr. Van Zandt to Mr. Upshur, dated January * last, 
and the reply of Mr. Calhoun to that note. * It does not embrace the 
guarantee as fully as was contemplated. If annexation should fail 
for a want of action on the part of the U. S., we are without any 
security against the consequences which may result to Texas, in 
consequence of opening negotiations upon the subject of annexation. 
Their obligations continue during the pendency of the negotiations. 
If negotiation fails, our file is uncovered, the enemy may charge 
through our ranks, and we have no reserve to march up to our rescue. 
It seems to me that after the arrival of Genl. Henderson, a direct 
application should have been made to the Govt, of the U. S. in 
accordance with the agreement between the Secretary of State and 
Qeni. Murphy, their fully accredited agent. However this has not 
been done. 'Tis well enough, we cannot go back, and therefore we 
must march forward with decisive steps. 

The Treaty is well in this respect, that Texas is to become a terri- 
tory of the U. S. if annexed. It cannot be ascertained that we have 
the ratio of population required to entitle us to be represented in the 
Congress of the U. S. as a State. We have no Constitution to present 
to the Govt, of the U. States in conformity with the Federal Consti- 
tution. And I would be extremely sorry if we have to become a part 
of the U. S. that the sacred principles of that instrument should ever 
be perverted to expediency, for I maintain that great principles are 
always in danger of subversion from that licentious and profligate 
political plea. Statesmen will never call it to their aid. Politicians 
and Demagogues will always carp upon it. 

I have felt and yet feel great solicitude for our fate. The crisis to 
Texas is everything. To the U. S. it is worth its Union. My toil 
has constantly been for the freedom and happiness of mankind, and 
if we are annexed, I shall hope we have accomplished much, but if 
from any cause, we should be rejected, we must redouble our energies, 
and the accompanying duplicate will express to you decisively what 
my purposes are. Texas can become Sovereign and independent, 
founded upon her own incalculable advantages of situation, and sus- 
tained by European influences without the slightest compromittal to 
her nationality. If the present measure of Annexation should fail 
entirely, and we are to be thrown back upon our own resources, fitx 
your eye steadily on the salvation of Texas, and pursue the course 
which I have indicated. I again declare to you that every day which 
passes only convinces me more clearly that it is the last effort at 
Annexation that Texas wiU ever make, nor do I believe that any 
solicitation or guarantee from the U. S. would at any future day 
induce her to consent to the measure.

The most careful attention will be rendered to the armaniMit pro- 
posed by the Govt, of the U. S. and direct communieation maintained 
with the Representatiye, Q&ol. Murphy, with whojn I am highly 
satisfied. This (jovt. wiU be as careful not to permii sli^t grouncte 
to produce alarm, or caU in acquisition their forces, m though it had 
to rely upon its own resources to vepeL an invadu^ enmmj. 

It is possible that the publications respecting the anaistice may 
have produced some effect in Washington: therefore, it is fiA that you 
should understand the subject exj^itly. 

In the instructions to our Commissioners they were aaeuired thaat 
no agreement would have a binding effect until it was referred to the 
President, and had his approve. That ajq^uoyal never has been 
given to it. Nor has any action been taken in conforsuty with its 
stipulations. One reason was alkuffieient to cause its rejectioa. 
Referring to Texas as a Department of Mexico, precluded all possi- 
bility of any official transactions under it. 

The Commissioners were excusable, because by signing it they 
obtained a safe convoy out of the country, which might not have 
been the case if they had refused their assent to the conditions. They 
were both well acquainted with Mexican faith and Mexiean perfidy, 
and would have been unwise to place any confidence in their pledges, 
when interest might have induced their violation. 

This despatch is written because several days would elapse before 
an express could reach Washington and return. It would at least 
delay communications a fortnight. Therefore as the Jouainese is 
important I do not care about official formality, tibe aubstaooe is what 
I am now after, and for that reasota I write.

City of Houston, May 10th. 1844- 
Messrs. I Van Zandt 

and 
J. PiNCKNEY Henderson 

etc. etc. etc. 
Gentlemen, 

I had contemplated the arrival of Dr. Jones here before this time, 
but he has written to me that he was quite indisposed, and not able 
to come. 

This point being more convenient than any other in Texas for the 
conducting of a correspondence abroad, — I have preferred it, until 
our matters have assumed some definite shape, and the question of 
annexation decided. By this time, I presume it is ascertained what 
will be the result. 

The U. S. Steam vessel Foinset touched at Qalveston on its way to 
Vera Cruz, and through Genl. Murphy I received some unofficial 
intelligence. Rumor says that the object of Mr. Thompson's visit 
to Mexico, is to settle definitively the boimdary line between the two 
countries, and that the U. S. is about to acquire a large portion of the 
Califomias, and settle the boundary of Texas to suit themselves. 

I learn imofficially from Corpus Christi, by rumor, that some 8 or 
10 Mexican Soldiers have been killed at that place, who came in for 
the purpose of suppressing smuggling into Mexico, from that point. 
Thus you see our people must be doing some little mischief. We 
must always enjoy some agreeable excitement, or things will not go 
very well. 

You will find that the Sec'y of State has addressed a despatch to 
the Legation at Washington, touching the subject of the Annistice,* 
which I took the liberty of opening, and find with pleasure that it 
contains the intelligence that was proper for you to have at this 
time. I did not deem it necessary to take any action upon the 
agreements signed by our Coms. further than to reject it silently. 
I suppose that Santa Anna would calculate, as a matter of course, 
that some action would take place under it, and consequently, that 
we would gain time by silence. You will perceive from the instruc- 
tions given to our Coms. that I had never changed my principles or 
opinions in relation to Texas, since 1836. I then made the fijrst 
suggestion in relation to its boundary as an Independency, that ever 
had been made, and for your information I transmit to you a paper, 
containing a letter of mine on the subject to Genl. Rusk, then Sec'y 
of War, after the Battle of San Jacinto,^ which if you should think

proper, as it might have some influence in settling the public mind 
in relation to some points embraced in it, you can have republished. 
Had the advice which it contains been carried out, another blow 
would never have been struck, or a gun fired by the enemy in Texas. 

I take the liberty of enclosing to you a copy of a letter addressed 
to Genl. Murphy some days since.** It was private, and when I 
commenced it, I had no expectation of making more than an ordinary 
friendly note. The boat leaving before I was aware of it, induced 
me to extend it to the capacity of a letter of some length; and I 
thought it probable that he might upon reflection, forward it to lus 
Govt. It contains some speculations which might have more or less 
influence on the subject of annexation. The Statesmen of the 
United States doubtless have viewed the subject in all its bearings, 
and will not derive any light from suggestions of mine. I desire to 
keep you advised of everything, no matter how unimportant it may 
seem, generally. 

If further negotiations have to take place with the Govt, of the 
U. S., from the cramped condition of our means, it will be proper to 
transfer them to Texas. The reason will be manifest in our want of 
funds to support our agents abroad. 

Since I have had time to reflect upon the provisions of the Treaty, 
I begin to entertain some apprehension that our Senate may not be 
disposed to ratify it. It strikes me, that the conditions are not quite 
liberal to Texas. I do not allude to that part of the Treaty that 
would admit us as a Territory, for I am satisfied that we cannot go 
into the Union on any other terms agreeably to the Federal Consti- 
tution of the United States. 

The Assumption of our debts by the U. S., is a very trifling item, 
and as the liabiUties were mostly incurred on the principle of equiva- 
lents, the whole debt will not amount to 5 Millions. All our 10 pr ct 
bonds, as well as I am advised were issued at 6 for 1. I think the 
principle of equivalents was estabUshed in the early part of 1839, 
and the depreciation was pretty rapid imtil the close of Lamars 
Admn., when Red backs were issued at 8 for 1. Thus you will per- 
ceive tiiat the U. S. would not in equity be boxmd to redeem the 
liabiUties of Texas at a higher rate than what they were issued. This 
will very much reduce the seeming amoimt of debt owing by Texas, 
and the dates of the several issues as well as the equivalents, can be 
ascertained with great accuracy. These are suggestions which I have 
not made to the public, nor do I intend that they shall be [so made]; 
so you wiU perceive that the U. S. will realize everything from the 
Treaty while Texas will derive very little. To day I expect to go to 
Galveston, and perhaps may remain there \mtil the arrival of the 
Neptime. I will have constant care to our affairs imtil they eventu-

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatches of 
the 26th of March and of the 6th and 12th of April 

The question of annexation is creating great excitement here and 
generally throughout the Union. The fate of the treaty is of course 
imcertain the indications are however decidedly against tiie ratifica- 
tion 

Nothing can change the scale but the fear of its controlling and 
overpowering weight with the people. ThOTe is now an evident reac- 
tion in public sentiment in favor of annexation, the current which 
seems to swell as it advances bids fair to sweep down its opponents. 
If the treaty should be rejected in time before the adjournment a joint 
action will be had in the form of [a] bill. It is to be feared however 
that there will not be time to affect anything during the present ses- 
sion. I shall continue to hold the language that the decission of the 
present Congress will be final and thereby endeavor to force the two 
Houses to carry out the joint action. 

Mr. Van Buren will likely be set aside and a new nomination made 
by the democratic party. If so and a proper candidate is selected 
who can go before the people on the Texas issue the triumph I think 
will be certain. The news from all quarters of the union upon the 
subject is of the most encouraging charactar. Whether the question 
can be delayed should the treaty be rejected is a matter for the decis- 
sion of the President. We shall at least be the gainers by the efforts 
now made. Great Britain is becoming more anxious and conse- 
quently would make greater exertions now than before in our behalf. 

I enquired of Mr Calhoim whether Great Britain or France had 
protested against annexation to this government he replied they had

Gentlemen, 

Intelligence which your last communications brought to me, seems 
adverse to the calculations which were made when Genl. Henderson 
was accredited to the U. S. If truly that Govt, is not disposed to 
consummate the plan of annexation, it would seem useless for him 
longer to remain at the Court of Washington. Whatever the desires 
of this Govt, or the people are, or might have been in relation to 
annexation, I am satisfied that they are not ambitious at this time, 
nor will ever be again to be seen in the attitude of a bone of conten- 
tion, to be worried or gnawed by the influence of conflicting poli- 
ticians. The views of the Executive of this coimtry, as well as its 
citizens, were fairly presented in a willingness to become annexed to

the U. S. And though the advantages presented to the U. S. were 
incalculably greater than those resulting to Texas, she was willing to 
stand the hazard of the adventure. 

The statesmen of that country appear to be united in opinions 
adverse to our admission into the Union of the North. We must 
therefore regard ourselves as a nation to remain forever separate. It 
would be unpleasant for us to enter into a community as a member 
where we should be regarded ungraciously by either of the political 
parties. Texas alone can well be sustained, and no matter what sin- 
cere desire we may have entertained for a connection with that 
Govt., and the affectionate enthusiasm that has existed in this towards 
it, we will be compelled to reconcile ourselves to our present condi- 
tion, or to assume such attitude towards other coimtries, as will cer- 
tainly look to our Independence. This can be atccomplished if the 
U. S. will carry out the pledges which they have already given. The 
compromittal of our national honor I cannot apprehend, nor would I 
entertain any proposition which could be adverse to our character as 
an Independent Nation; but Texas can now command interests 
which will require no such sacrifice. We must act!! You Gentn. 
will be advised by the former communications from this Govt, and 
act in accordance with them. It would seem from the complexion 
of matters at Washington, that Genl. Hendersons remaining there 
longer would be unnecessary. As indicated in my last communica- 
tion, negotiations can be very well conducted at this Govt, not 
designing to cast any reflections upon the representatives of this 
Govt, at Washington in whom the executive has the highest confi- 
dence. Moments of leisure could be employed here, and even hours 
and days commanded, which is not permitted when urgent despatches 
arrive. The locality of our Seat of Govt is such, that the Executive 
has had to substitute himself in correspondence for the Sec'y of 
State, and dispense with the services of that valuable officer, for the 
sakeof despatch. To morrow I intend to leave here for the Seat of Govt. 

Genl. Henderson will, previous to leaving Washington City, in 
company with Mr. Van Zandt who will remain at that court, wait 
upon the Executive, Mr. Tyler, and assure him that this govt, relying 
upon the pledges given by that Govt, will confidently expect that no 
molestation to Texas by Mexico wiU be permitted, or the aids already 
ordered withdrawn, without the consent of this Govt. The measure 
of annexation having been taken up at the instance of the U.S., ought 
to secure Texas and fortify her by the U. S. against all inconvenience 
arising from having opened negotiations upon that subject. The 
Treaty having been signed and submitted to the Senate is all that 
can be performed on the part of Texas. Further solicitation on her 
part would present her as an object of commisseration to the civilized 
world. If the embarrassments of our condition have presented us 
in a humiliating posture, and we have to brook mortification it fur-

niahes no excuse to us for voluntary degradation. Therefore it is 
that my purpose is fixed in relation to the subject of which I have 
treated. The desires of the people of Texas, with my love of repose — 
(this far I am selfish) had determined me in favor of annexation. 
My judgment though rendered subservient to their inclinations and 
my own, has never fully ratified the course adopted. Yet in aU 
good faith I have lent and afforded every aid to its consummation.

Dispatch 121. 

Legation op Texas 
Washington D. 0. May 26. 1844 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 
Deab Sib 

We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch 
of the 2d. Inst., with the enclosures concerning the Armistice, and 
also a dispatch from the President dated the 10th Inst, enclosing a 
copy of a letter addressed by him to General Murphy. 

We herewith forward you copies of correspondence had with this 
Grovemment since the date of our last dispatch. 

The terms of the Armistice as published having had a very injurious 
effect upon the question of Annexation, and having previously 
received information from General Houston that the skme was not 
approved by him, we deemed it both proper and necessary, in reply 
to Mr. Calhoim's note, to state distinctly (as far as we were informed) 
its whole history and present nullity. 

The debate on the treaty has been progressing about a week, Mr. 
Benton leading off against and Mr. Walker for it.' They have been 
followed by Messrs Choate, Miller and McDuffie, the latter in its 
favour. 

Mr. McDuffie, it is stated, has introduced in the Senate a joint 
resolution, declaring for annexation, as proposed in the treaty. 
This being done, it is said that Mr. Benton has changed his position 
and intimated his readiness to support the resolution. If so, and those 
of the democracy who have before gone off with him shall likewise 
return, the chances for its success we think very encourageing. This, 
however, may be a trick of Mr. Benton's to mislead the friends of 
Texas at the Baltimore Convention, which meets on Monday, next.

We have to commimicate to you the news of the rejection of the

of Texas to the United States, by the Senate. It was discussed very 
warmly and fully for several weeks by that body, and on the 8th.

not rote.' You will see from the a{>eeche6 uutde during the dis- 
cussion (which we will send you as soon as we can collect them) 
that the majority of those who voted against ratifying the treaty^ 
are in favour of annexing Texas at some futiu^ period. It cannot 
be disguised that party con8iderati<»s influ^ioed many of those, 
who voted against the ratification, to oppose it. The question of 
the annexation of Texas to this Government has (as you doubtless 
have seen from the newspapers of tUs country) become strictly a 
party question between the democrats and wh%s in the priding 
contest for the next Presidency, and should the former party succeed 
in electing their nominee we can not doubt that Texas can be annexed 
under his administration, if she desire it. We called upon President 
Tyler this morning, and he informed us that he intended to send into 
the House of Representatives a message calling their attention to the 
subject of annexing Texas — ^he was then in consultation with his 
Cabinet on the subject; and asked us if we had any thing to say or 
furnish him, which he could commimicate with his message, but as 
we had received a few days since a communication from the Presi- 
dent, dated at the City of Houston May 17th, instructing us to press 
the measure of annexation no further on this Government, and 
directing the Undersigned, Special Agent etc, to take his leave and 
return to Texas, we did not feel ourselves at liberty to interfere, 
and therefore replied that we had nothing to say or communicate. 

Col Benton introduced a bill this morning, in the Senate proposing 
the annexation of Texas. From what we have learned of its pro- 
visions, it would not be acceptable to the Government or people of 
Texas, and will not recrive the support of either of the two great 
political parties in this country. 

We have the honor to be with great respect.

the subject of annexation, which, upon its receipt by the House, was 
ordered to be printed and refered to the Committee of Foreign Affairs. 
No further action will likely be had upon the subject before the ad- 
journment. Our friends think it policy to await the action of the 
next session, or it may be possible that the President may deem it 
necessary to have a called session in August or September. While 
many object to any affirmative action at the present session, a very 
large majority of both Houses express themselves friendly to the 
measure at a future period. The indications of popular sentiment in 
almost every quarter, seem favorable to its ultimate success, should 
Texas continue to desire the Union. On to morrow, or as early as I 
can collect them, I shaU forward to your Department a large number 
of papers and documents, which will enable you to see both sides of 
the case as represented here. 

The friends of Texas in this coimtry are determined to press the 
question, unless our Government shall decline its further prosecution. 

Having, at the time of my departure for Washington, left much of 
my private business in an imsettled state which requires my personal 
attention at the earliest day possible, I beg leave, through you, most 
respectfully to tender to the President this my resignatjon, and 
request that I may be furnished with my letter of recall as soon as the 
same can conveniently be forwarded to me. 

My resignation is forwarded at this time with a hope that I may 
be enabled to reach home by the commencement of the faU courts- 
It may however be possible that the President of the United States 
may determine to call an extra session of Congress, for the purpose 
of settling the question of annexation. In that event I should be 
desirous to remain during the session. Should Oeneral Houston, 
therefore, deem it not improper, I hope I may be so instructed.

made known to him the desire of our government that the present 
position of the military and naval forces of the United States sta- 
tioned upon the borders of Texas should remain unchanged. To this 
the President replied that no important change would be made in the 
previous orders and arrangements except that the commanders 
would be directed to correspond with the United States Charg^

The President of the United States also expressed his determination

Sm, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your several de- 
spatches to the 18th of June Ulto. 

In consequence of the absence of the President and a pressure of 
business upon the Dept., I write you at this time very briefly. 

In a private letter which I recieved from his Excellency yesterday, 
he says "I enclose you a letter from Mr. Van Zandt in which he 
announces having sent his resignation to you. You will accept his 
resignation in the most courteous terms and express to him the 
confidence of the Executive in his patriotism and integrity"* In 
accepting the tender of your resignation, allow me to add to the 
expression of the President the assurance that the Department has 
every reason to be satisfied with your conduct as Charg6 d' Affaires, 
at Washington and with the very able zealous and faithful manner 
in which you have discharged all the arduous duties which have from 
time to time been devolved on you. The interests of the country 
have been well sustained by you and I devoutly hope you may live 
to enjoy its approbation and its highest rewards. I regret that 
circumstances have rendered your resignation necessary but am 
well aware that the compensation is not sufficient to support you 
and justify you in longer neglecting your private affairs 

Enclosed I send you your leave of absence to be presented to 
the Secretary of State of the U. S. whienever you are ready to leave. 
It is not deemed necessary that you should remain, at your post to 
await a call of the U. S. Congress nor is it the wish of the govt that 
you should stay even if a Special Session should be determined on. 

It is my desire that the matter of compensation to Texas by the 
U. S. for the goods taken from our Collector at Bryarly's landing 
and the arms etc taken from Col Snively's command should be 
pressed upon the consideration of the U S Government 

On leaving you will place the archives of your legation in the Hands 
of Mr Raymond, who will act in the capacity of Charg6 untill an 
appointment is made of a successor

Enclosed I send for your information Copies of two letters lately

other from Gen Adrian WoU announcing to Texas a resumption of 
hostilities on the part of Gen. Santa Anna^ The complaint set 
up by Gen Santa Anna that Texas has acted perfidiously in not 
sending Commissioners to Mexico agreeably to the terms of an 
Armistice proposed at Sabinas by the Commissioners who were senJt 
there is without any just foundation in fact. As it was one of the 
expressed and agreed conditions upon which those Conunissioners 
were sent that any agreement which might be made by them should 
not be of any force unless confirmed by the Supreme Govt, of Mexico 
on the one part and Texas on the other* This Govemmeiit imuke- 
diately on its receipt, rejected this proposed Armistice, information 
of which was informally given to Capt. Elliot^ the medium of com- 
munication between us «Ad Meodco. On the oth^ hand, the Supreme 
Govt, of Mexico failed to give us notice that she had approved the 
acts of her Commissioners. So tha^ both by the act of rejection 
on the part of the Govt., and the omission on the part of Mexieo to 
notify Texas that she had approved and confirmed the Axmistice 
the same was void and utterly nulL 

The true cause of this renewal of hostilities I presume to be the

In [M-es^iting the commimicaUon r^ened to, and in taking leave

by the Secretary of State of the United States to renew to the Gov-

has taken char^ of the Archives of tjiis Legation until the successor 
of General Murphy shall arrive; and that during this interim it wUl 
give him great satisfaction to cummunicate \dth the Honorable

to this country and that of the United States. 

By recent advices from the South west, the undersigned has

has proceeded to the Seat of Government of Texas, and that under 
the present existing circumstances he will be excused for requesting 
at this eariy moment to be made acquainted with such parts of the

desire of the President that you should assume the duties as acting 
Charg6 untill a Successor shall have been appointed and arrived at 
Washington City. 

You will take the earliest opportunity to notify the Government 
of the United States that a Council will be held at Tawacoro* Creek 
near the Brazos on the 15th Sept next between Commissioners of 
Texas and the Conmianche and other Indians who reside within 
and upon our limits, and invite that Government to send a Commis- 
sioner or agent to be present at that time and place, to aid in pro- 
moting the reciprocally important object of effecting a peace with 
these Indians. 

The place fixed upon for holding this Council is the same at which 
the Council was held in March 1843 at which Govr. Butler was 
present. The time is fixed for the 16th Septr. but it is not very 
probable that the Indians will come in exactly at the day appointed 
or that much will be effected before the latter part of the month. 

Should a Commissioner or agent be sent to attend this Coimcil on 
the part of the U. States it would be desireable that he should be 
attended by a large escort of Dragoons not that any danger is appre- 
hended to the Commissioners but for the purpose of making an

countries — a course which I can adopt with great cordiality, in 
view of the common origin of our people, and that identity of interest, 
which seem so clearly to point to our destiny. 

It remains my painful duty, further to say, that the gratification 
I feel in being the orgMi of my Government in the expression of these 
sentiments, is much tempered by the chastening circumstances 
which have attended my arrival in this Republic, in the death of 
two distinguished feDow citizens — Gen Murphy and Col. Green, two 
of our public functionaries. 

I hare been, however, much consoled by the generous sympathy 
which I have every where met from your people. This is the more 
consolatory, as it will be evidence to their friends and afficted f uni- 
lies at home, of the confidence and respect, which, I have the satis- 
faction to know, were enjoyed by them amongst the citizens ot this 
Republic.

Reply of Mr. Jones to the address of Qen. Howard 

General, 

I take great pleasure in receiving and recognizing you as the 
accredited representative of the United States to Texas; and in 
assuring you that the friendly sentiments and kind wishes which 
you have expressed on behalf of the President of the United States 
and the people of that country towards the government and people 
of this, are highly appreciated and fuUy reciprocated by the Presi- 
dent and people of Texas. 

Adverting to the fact of your former connexion with the President 
of Texas and the intimate personal relations which have for a great 
length of time existed between yourself and him rendering your 
appointment, so very acceptable to his Excellency I am happy to 
witness in your selection as their Representative here another proof 
of the friendship of the United States, towards Texas 

I shall take much pleasure General, in co-operating with you in 
the work of preserving the good understanding which now so happily 
exists between the two countries, and in drawing still closer the ties 
which should unite them. In the performance of a duty so agreeable 
to myself I am well satisfied I shall be acting in accordance with the 
wishes and the feelings of the people of Texas who ever mindful of 
the identity of the origin language laws and customs of the two 
nations ardently desire united destiny. 

The sentiments which you have expressed, on this occasion in refer- 
ence to the recent melancholy death of the two distinguished func-

296 Ali£EBICAN HISTORICAIj ASSOCIATION. 

Information recieved from the city of Mexico through the agent 
of the United States Oovemment there^ has made known the fact 
that, Oen. Santa Anna is engaged in raising funds, and recruiting 
an army for the avowed purpose of attempting to subjugate Texas 
and that in pursuance of his design he has already despatched a 
number of troops from the city of Mexico and is concentrating them 
and other forces upon the Rio Grande. 

The fact, that the negotiations for an armistice in progress at 
Sabinas in Feb. last were suddenly interrupted upon the receipt 
of the intelligence by Mexico that a proposition for the annexation 
of Texas to the United States had been submitted by the latter 
country, and that subsequently the information of the conclusion 
of the treaty had given great umbrage to the Mexican Govt, taken 
in connexion with the letter of (Jen. Woll^ seems conclusively to 
indicate that these movements of the enemy have been caused, by 
pending negotiations between the United States and Texas on the 
subject above referred to. 

I have consequently called this day upon Gren. Howard, Chargfi 
d' Affaires of the U States requesting him to take early action upon 
the assurances given to this Govt, by Gen. Murphy and by Mr. Cal- 
houn, and that the promised aid might be rendered to Texas by his 
Government. 

Enclosed herewith is a copy of his reply to my communication by 
which you will perceive that Gen. Howard thinks it necessary to refer 
the whole matter back to his government for its action, and to await 
instructions from the City of Washington. This delay has given 
great dissatisfaction to the President 

It was his impression that he should at any time in case of threat- 
ened danger to Texas command the aid of the Military and Naval 
force of the United States in the Gulf and upon our frontier. This 
was expected to be rendered in case of emergency like the present, 
even, without the delay of an appeal to the government at Wash- 
ington 

It is the wish of the President therefore that you should immediately 
make known to the President of the United States his imderstanding 
of the pledges given for the security and protection of Texas during 
the pendency of negotiations for Annexation, and his conviction of 
the importance to the success of that measure of immediate action 
on the part of the U States government, in the employment of their 
land forces on our frontier in preventing the threatened injury to 
Texas; and of such other means as may be deemed adviseable and 
proper for the same object. 

TTiis Government trusts that the action of the United States in 
reference to this subject will be prompt and efficient, a course which 

a One of the indosorai.

you will urge upon them by every consideration in your power to 
offer. 

Gen. Howard despatches an express to-morrow to Gen. Taylor at 
Fort Jesup by whom I shall send you this communication. 

Shoidd not the required aid be rendered by the United States, it is 
probable you will be instructed to break off all negotiations having 
for their object the annexation of Texas to the United States, nor 
can we wait beyond a reasonable time for their determination to be 
made known. 

I have the honor to remain 
very Respectfully

I have delayed writing to you for some time, with the expectation 
daily of receiving something from yoiu* department. The Steamers 
having left for New York, and all commimication being thereby 
rendered uncertain I shall delay no longer. 

In my last dispatch I informed you that I anticipated an early 
and satisfactory adjustment of the Red River difficulty.*' I had 
just then had an interview with Mr. Calhoim in which I submitted 
to him the points upon which we rested the claim for indemnity, to 
all of which, after some Httle discussion he assented, and promised 
to submit the matter to the President for his determination, at the 
next Cabinet meeting. This he did, but instead of the President's 
approving it, he and the cabinet all dissented. The Attorney Gen- 
eral, Mr. Nelson then drew up a written and lengthy opinion in oppo- 
sition to the demand, after which Mr. Calhoim sent for, and made 
known to me the result, submitting to me the opinion of the Attorney 
General for my inspection and consideration. Upon an examina- 
tion of it with, all the other objections urged, I informed Mr. Cal- 
houn that if he would make me a communication upon the subject

in reply to my former demands, I was prepared to enter upon the 
discussion. He then suggested that it would perhaps be more satis- 
factory to discuss it, first, verbally, at the Department, and that, 
then, in the event we did not agree, the written correspondence 
might be opened. To this I assented, bdieving they would more 
readily abandon their position before the committal cm paper against 
the demand, than afterwards. On the next day I repaired to the 
state department where we took up the matter and discussed it 
near two hours each day for about a week, exploring the whole 
range of cases and authorities from the earUest writers up. The 
result was that at the end of the investigation my positions were 
fully admitted by the Secretary of State, and I understand sanctioned 
by the majority of the Cabinet. Mr. Calhoim then drew up a formal 
reply acknowledging their Uability for the damages. Before sending 
it to the President he submitted it for my inspection, after some 
sUght modifications I told him it would be satisfactory. The com- 
munication was then forwarded to the President who had gone to 
Norfolk. Upon an examination he dissented from some portion of 
the conclusions of Mr. Calhoun and returned the commimication, 
suggesting certain modifications. On the receipt of this answer 
Mr. Calhoun sent for me and expressed a desire that the case should 
rest until the President returns to the city, which will be in the coiu^e 
of the present week; when he anticipated a removal of every diffi- 
culty. To this coiuse I have consented. I have been thus explicit 
that you may understand the cause of the delay. 

You will of course have seen that the Mexican Congress have voted 
Four millions of dollars and thirty thousand men for the invasion 
of Texas, also the manifesto of Genl WoU to Genl Houston* declaring 
the intention to re-commence hostiUties against Texas. I have seen 
likewise the correspondence both official and private, of the United 
States Charge de' Affaires in Mexico to the State Department here. 
From a survey of the whole facts that have been developed I think 
we may conclude that it is the intention of Santa Anna, again, to 
commence the war upon some scale, the measure and extent of 
which will much depend upon the encoxuragement that he may 
receive abroad. If England winks at the measiu'e, we may look out 
for a formidable effort. England will of course view all the circum- 
stances, and pursue that poUcy which her interest may seem to 
dictate. There is no occasion for a panic in Texas, and [it] should 
by all means be avoided. You know the pledges of the President 
of the United States. I think we may rely with every confidence 
that they wiU be fulfilled. Your Representative here should be kept 
advised as frequently as possible upon this subject, and especially 
as to the views and wishes of the President. 

a That is, the letter of June 10, 1844.

There is advertised to be sold on the 20th. Inst, a large amount 
of the pubhc arms at Ne^r York. I am endearouring to get the 
sale, of three thousand stand of them, suspended until we can see 
whether we need them or not. They can be got low, and it may 
probably be to our advantage to secure them, especially if we can do 
so in such way as to pay for them out of any indemnity we may get 
from this Govenmient. Z merely make the suggestion in order to 
have the opinion of the President upon the subject. 

The two Mexican Steamers now repairing in New York, I learn 
from Mr. Brower are making great efforts to complete their works 
and outfit. I send you a copy of Mr. Brower's letter. The suggestion 
which he makes in regard to the effort to seize the vessels I think 
might be successfully attempted near New York. I went to Balti- 
more a few days ago partly to see what could probably be done. If 
the proper papers and powers were placed in the hands of your Repre- 
sentative here, with proper caution and energy, I think arrangements 
might be made to seize them, without a dollars expense to Texas, by 
proposing to some proper individual the spoils, or a portion of them 
for pay. The vessels will not likely get off before the 1st. of October. 

I expect by the next mail notice of the acceptance of pry resigna- 
tion. I hope my successor if one has been appointed may arrive 
with my recall, that I may be able to explain the situation of matters 
here, as present appearances indicate that this will soon be the theatre 
of important action in our affairs. 

« « « « « « 4ea 

Since writing the foregoing I have seen Mr. Calhoun who informed 
me, that it was stated in the dispatch just received from Mr. King 
the American Minister in Paris that in an interview, which that 
gentleman had with the King of the French His Majesty told Mr. 
King that they wished Texas to femain independent, upon commer- 
cial groimds, but would take no part in any controversy growing out 
of the question of annexation. 

I remain with high regard

since, by a person who saw it that there appeared much anxiety on 
the part of the officers to hurry forward the work — from which he 
supposed Dispatches may have been reed., pertaining to the part 
they may be designed to take in Santa Anna's new project for the 
invasion of Texas. If any part, naturally, the object would be to 
use them for blockading the Texian shipping ports, especially that 
Texas, now, has no Naval force in commission. It has appeared to 
me that the Government and people of Texas should look to the pro- 
tection of their sea coast, and without any bustle, but as quietly as 
possible plan some expedition by which to board and take those 
Steamers if they appear off Galveston. It appears to me an ordinary 
Steamer, under American colors, properly manned with men of right 
nerve, well equipped, might accomplish the object. Of course it is 
for you to make any suggestion you may please, to the Texian Execu- 
tive upon the subject."

I have the honor to enclose you herewith the note of Mr. Calhoun 
of the 14th. Inst, together with the documents which accompanied 
it, and my reply of this date to the same. 

If the JPresident shall acquiesce in the acquittal of Captain Cooke, 
and the offer to return or make compensation for the arms, it will 
only be necessary to indicate at what point the arms are desired 
to be dehvered. If it be wished, new arms will be given instead of 
those taken. If a monied compensation be prefered, it will be 
necessary to await an appropriation by Copgress. As the arms will 
likely be needed in the country, and less difficulty would attend

their acceptance, it seems to me it would be policy to receive them 
instead of awaiting the tardy action of Congress. 

I have been told that Captain Cooke has a letter from Colonel 
Snively in which he expresses his gratitude for the kindness shown 
him by Cooke. If this be true, perhaps it would be unnecessary to 
prosecute the case further. 

I hope the President will be pleased at the prospect o*f a favorable 
adjustment of the Red River difficulty.^ The assurances given are 
perhaps as favorable as we could expect under the circumstances. 
In fact as to the Uability, every thing is conceded which could be 
desired. If I had had "full powers" for the purpose, it would have 
been more formal to have concluded a convention, but not having 
them I think the matter is as well shaped as could be. 

The Affidavit of the Collector and others as to the introduction, 
seizure and value of the goods will be all sufficient, to transmit to 
the Congress of the United States, but these should be obtained 
and forwarded to this Legation as early as possible. I told Mr. Cal- 
houn during the discussion I was of opinion, although not authorized 
to say so officially, that our Government would be willing, as an 
act of courtesy, to relinquish the claim for damages so far as the 
property actually belonged to the United States. I should be much 
gratifyed if my opinion as thus expressed should be sanctioned by 
the President. 

We have no further news from Mexico. The papers of yesterday 
contain a nunor that the Mexican loan of four millions had been taken 
by Great Britain, but I think there is nothing to substantiate the 
report. 

We have no mail yet from Texas. 

The President and Cabinet are discussing the propriety of a caP 
of Congress to consider how far Texas should be protected against 
Mexico. This is Cabinet day, and if anything important transpires 
I will advise you of it to morrow.

Extract of the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry held at Fort 
Leavenworth, Mo, in the month of April, pursuant to "general 
orders" No. 6, dated February 28th. 1844, instituted by order of the 
President, "to examine into and report the facts respecting the 
manner in which Captain P. St. George Cooke, of the United States 
Dragoons, discharged the duties assigned to him for the protection 
of the Caravan of Santa Fe traders over the territory of thae United 
States to the Texan frontier in May and June 1843, whether, in his 
march, he disarmed the Texan force under Colonel Sniveiy, if so, in 
what territory and in what manner; and whether his conduct was 
harsh and imbecoming." 

"The Opinion''. 

In view of the foregoing facts, the Court is of opinion, that Captain 
P. St George Cooke, of the Regiment of United States Dragoons, 
on the 30th. of June 1843, disarmed a Texan force under Colonel 
Sniveiy, within the territory of the United States, by causing <^6m 
to lay down their arms, under an appropriate exhibition of military 
force of United States Dragoons; and that there was nothing in the 
conduct of Captain Cooke that was harsh and unbecoming" The 
Court is further of opinion that Captain Cooke did Bot iexeeed the 
authority for the protection of the lawful trade of the Sctnta Fe 
Caravan, "derived from the orders of the Secretary of War to the 
Commanding General of the army, dated March 28th. 1843, and 
of the Adjutant General to Colonel Kearney,^ dated March 29th. 
1843", and that the confidence reposed in him by his Government 
was not " in any degree misplaced".

it necessary to make any report to General Head Quarters. It will 
be seen from the Lt Colonels' report, as well as from the account of 
the affair given by the Texan Collector, in No 4," that the Military

He[a]d Quaetebs Fobt Towson 

SOth April 1843 
Cap. 

For the information of the Commanding General 2d. Mil. Dept. 
I have to inform you that on tuesday, 11th. inst, I was informed by 
the master of the Steam Boat, Fort Towson, that he had a large quan- 
tity of public stores, as well as merchandise, etc, belonging to mer- 
chants of Doaksville and Sutlers of the posts of Fort Towson and 
Washita, and that he was apprehensive of an attack from the Texan 
Custom-house officers, and requested a guard for his boat, which was 
lying about 35 miles, by land, below this. I sent Lt Merrill of the 
Riflemen, with 30 of his Company, and Lieut Ernst, of the 6th. In- 
fantry. Lieut Merrill has this morning returned, leaving Lieut 
Ernst and 10 men to come up on the boat. — No appearance of an 
attack — ^The river is rising and the boat expected to day. I am told 
these goods were stored on the Texan shore to lighten the boat, and 
seized by the Custom-house Officers of Texas, and afterwards taken 
by force from the store by the Master of the Fort Towson, therefore, 
he feared an attempt to recapture them. 

Although I do not sanction any attack upon Texas, I could not 
allow our boats to be molested. This was also the opinion of Col. 
Churchill. Immediately upon the news of their seizure, the Mer- 
chants of Doaksville etc sent an express to Washington, Texas, to 
demand their release. I wrote our Charge d' Affaires, requesting 
him to use his influence to procure the restoration of these goods.

Sir 

I have the honor to enclose you herewith a copy of my note of the 
10th. instant to the Secretary of State of the United States request- 
ing the delivery of two boys said to have been taken prisoners on ih/& 
Trinity River, and now among the Wichitaw Indians, together with 
a copy of the reply thereto of the 17th. instant which I have >u3t 
received. You will perceive from my note to Mr. Calhoun that I 
derived the information concerning the boys through the letter of 
Mr. Upshaw Chickasaw Agent. I have no knowledge of their names 
or ages. It was stated by the Indian Chief who gave the information 
to Mr. Upshaw, that their parents were murdered at the time of 
their capture. The boys will no doubt be recovered and sent to the 
Chickasaw Agency. Would it not be well to publish the fact that 
the friends of the boys may take the necessary st^s to secure their 
safe return ?

I did not deem it necessary to await your instructions in this mat- 
ter, but thought it best to act promptly lest the delay might embar- 
rass the object. I hope the steps I have taken may meet the appro- 
bation of the President 

I have just received a letter from Mr. Brower, dated 16th. instant, 
in reply to certain inquiries which I addressed him respecting the 
Mexican Steamers now at New York. I send you an extract of the 
same. In a few days I expect to hear from him again when I may 
think proper to write you further on the subject. 

With the highest respect I have the honor to be 
Your Most Obedt. Servt.

(Extract from Mr. Brower's letter to Mr. Van Zandt) 

"Consulate op Texas New York 

August 16th, 18U 
Dear Sm 

I acknowledge with pleasure your much estd. letter of 12th inst. 

I have heard it rumored that the Steamers "Guadalupe" and 
"Montezuma" are to be manned, or partially so with U. S. seamen 
when they leave here, but as yet, I am not enabled to write you with 
that degree of certainty upon this point which I hope to do in a few 
days, having a friend, who can approach the matter in the right place, 
as I think, now seeking information for me. 

I think with you, it might not be policy to interfere with the ship- 
ment of the crews of these steamers — except so far to have knowledge 
of the fact, as to rebut any charges by Mexico against the United 
States and her citizens for doing towards Texas that which, in repeated 
cases, Mexico has attained for herself. Nor do I believe but that 
Amer. seamen on board these ships might easily be taught to feel 
more patriotism for Texas than Mexico, provided a few good and 
sagacious friends of Texas could be shipped on board each vessel. 

There can be but little doubt that England is endorsing Mexico 
in the proposed campaign. England prefers Texian Independence 
with free ports, and second to this she sees her interest clearly in 
returning Texas to the Gk)vt. of Mexico in preference to annexation 
to the U. S. She is acting on this principle with that secrecy and 
sagacity which control all the great measures of her Cabinet Counsels."

Legation op Texas 

Washington [City] llUi. Sept. 18U 
Hon Anson Jones 

Secretary of State 
Sib 

Your dispatch of the 13th. of July, last, notifying me of the accept- 
ance of my resignation was not received until a short time ago, when 
I was prostrate with a severe billions attack and confined to my bed. 
To-day is the first time for twenty one days that I have left my rooms. 
I have this day presented my recall and taken my leave of the Presi- 
dent, and shall start for home as soon as I am able to travel. I will 
forward you by the next opportunity a copy of my speech, and the 
Presidents reply. 

I send you with this several communications made to and received 
from the Department of State of the United States, which will explain 
themselves. 

I have seen the valuation of the guns taken from Colonel Snively's 
command and think them estimated at their full worth. 

Mr. Raymond will acquaint you of the receipt of several despatches 
directed to him. The one in relation to the Indian treaties, requiring 
immediate attention, I deemed it best to make a communication 
upon the subject. Mr Raymond then caUed at the Department and 
superintended the arrangement. 

I had hoped to be able to give the subject of the movements of the 
United States troops and Navy more attention than I have been able 
to do. Mr Raymond has seen Mr Calhoim several times on the sub- 
ject, and Mr. Calhoun has been kind enough to caU at my room fre- 
quently, but it was impossible, owing to my feeble state, to discuss 
the matter at any length. I have not learned what will exactly be 
their course and how far they will go. General Howard will be fully 
instructed so Mr. Calhoim informed me; — other important papers will 
be sent him to commimicate to you, — eJl of which I trust may be sat- 
isfactory to the President. 

I have great confidence that Polk will be elected, if so, annexation 
will be certain, if Texas continue to desire it, which I trust she may. 

Mr Calhoim has promised to show us the dispatch to General 
Howard. 

I shall deliver as directed all the archives of the Legation to Mr 
Raymond, who, I have informed the President and Secretary of State, 
will proceed to discharge the duties of the Legation, as Acting Charg6 
d' Affaires. 

I shall write you again when I am more able. 
With great regard 
Truly Yours 

Isaac Van Zandt.

Your dispatch of tJie 29th. of July, last, addressed to me «s Acting 
Charg6 d' Affaires, in relation to a contemplated Indian Council, was 
received on the 23rd. ultimo, at a time when Mr Van Zandt, who did 
not present his letter of recall until yesterday, was very ill. He 
however immediately addressed a note to the Secretary at State of 
the United States upon the subject; and the orders from the Adjutant 
General's Office and the instructions from the Conunissioner of Indian 
Affairs of the United States, copies of which were aiclosed to you in 
dispatch No 130, will inform you of the steps taken by this Govern- 
ment in the matter. 

The Conmiissioner, Captain Boone, with his company of dragoons, 
will probably reach the Council groimd about the 1st. proximo, but in 
any event, it is to be hoped the Indians will be detained until his 
arrival. 

Your dispatch of the 5th. ultimo enclosing copies of the replies of 
the President and Secretary of War and Marine to the Communication 
from Genl Adrian Woll of the 19th of Jime last, was also received the 
23rd. ultimo. I showed the President's reply to Mr Calhoun who 
expressed much gratification at its tone and spirit.

COBBB6PONDBNCE WITH THE XmiTm) STATES. 311 

Your dispateh of the 6th. nltbno, by express, concerning the 
immediately expected hostile moTements of Mexico^ with the accom- 
panying documents, reached here two weeks ago. Cki the same 
evening I called upon the Secretary of State (Mr. Van Zaadt being 
too ill to leave his room) and in pursuance of your instructions made 
known to him and afterwards to the President of the United States, 
the President's understanding of the pledges and assurances given by 
their Government for the protection and support of Texas against 
foreign aggression. The Secretary of State informed me of the receipt 
t>f Grenl. Howard's dispatches upon the same subject, and assured me 
they would be immediately considered and acted upon by his Gov- 
ernment; and that Oen^al Howard would be amply instructed in 
regard to the measures that would be adopted by this Government in 
fulfillment of its pledges, and directed to commimicate the same to 
your Department. I had several more interviews with him in 
reference to this subject, and he had the kindness to call repeatedly 
at Mr Van Zandts lodgings, where it was discussed as thoroughly as 
his weak state of health would admit. The true state of the case 
having been brought to the attention of this Government by the 
correspondence which passed between your Department and Genl. 
Howard, it seemed to be unnecessary to address a written communi- 
cation upon it to the Department of State here. 

We have been £&own a very strong and able paper from the Depart- 
ment of State of the United States to their Minister at Mexico to be 
communicated by him to the Mexican Government, protesting against 
a renewal of the war and its manner of conduct against Texas, and 
declaring that the United States will view any attack upon her by 
Mexico as highly offensive to th^n. — A cop/ of it will be furnished 
you by Genl. Howard. 

Since writing the above Mr Calhoun has sent us his dispatch, to 
Genl Howard, to peruse, and to our surprise nothing was mentioned 
in it respecting the disposition to be made of the land and naval 
forces of the United States in order to our protection. I inamediately 
called at the Department of State and expressed to Mr Calhoun my 
surprise and disappointment at the omission. He replied that the 
assurances of his Government on that point were already full and 
exphcit; that I might however reassure my Government that the 
orders, given at the time tiie treaty was made, to Brig' GenL Taylor 
and conmaodore Connor, were continued in their full force and 
operation — that there would be no change in the present position 
and organization of the army — that a large naval force would soon be 
in the Gulf and that two or more (or as many as might be necessary) 
vessels of War would be stationed at Galveston, before any attack 
should foe attempted upon that place.

The painful news qf Grenl. Howards' death reached here on the 
15th. Instant, and caused among his numerous friends and acquaint- 
ances the most unfeigned grief. 

On account of the interesting position of Texian affairs the President 
of the United States lost no time in appointijog another Chargfi 
d' Affaires to our Government. The appointment has been confered 
upon Andrew Jackson Donnelson, nephew of Grenl Jackson. A 
special message was dispatched to him on yesterday morning ^th 
his commission and instructions. If he accepts, of which no doubt is 
entertained, he is directed to proceed with all possible speed to our 
seat of Government and communicate to your Department the meas- 
ures taken and to be taken by this Government in fulfillment of its 
pledges of protection. In addition to the protest of this Government 
to Mexico, refered to in my last dispatch, a copy of which the United

the return of Commodore Connor, with the vessels of War imder his

command, to the Gulf and along our coast, Mr Donnelson has been 
authorized and instructed, upon representations being made to him 
by our Government that there is reason to apprehend an attack 
upon our frontiers by any of the various tribes of Indians upon and 
adjacent to the boimdary line of Texas and the United States, 
through the instigation of emisaries of the Mexican Government or 
from any other cause, and upon a request being made by us that 
United States troops be stationed within our limits for the purpose of 
restraining by force these Indians, to order the troops from Fort 
Jesup, Fort Towson etc to such points and places in Texas as may 
be deemed best for our security. Probably San Antonio would be 
one desirable point at which to station a large detachment. Mexico 
could not complain of such a step for it would be in strict accordance 
with the 33rd. article of her treaty of 1831 with the United States, and, 
under that article of the treaty, Texas has the right to demand this 
course of the United States. 

A letter has just been received by this Grovemment from its 
Cherokee Agent giving information that Mexican emisaries have 
been and are now among the Indian[s] on the borders of the United 
States and Texas, endeavouring to instigate them to join our enemy 
in the contemplated invasion; and I am confident you will be enabled, 
at home, to furnish such facts and evidence to the United States 
Charg6 d' Affaires, in relation to the disposition and probable designs 
of these Indians under the influence of Mexico, as will fully authorize 
him to give the orders alluded to. 

The President of the United States left the city on the 17th. inst 
on a visit of a few days to the Springs in Virginia. Mr Calhoun will 
leave next week on a visit to South Carolina.

to increase their equipment, or armament in the smallest degree 
within the territories of the United States. He also informed me 
that the President has dispatched a special agent, a legal gentleman 
of this city, to New York, who with Mr Hoffman the United States 
District Attorney, is directed to keep strict watch upon ttieir move- 
ments, collect evidence, and, in case they commit any act contaraven- 
ing the laws of neutrality, to institvite the necessary l^al process 
for their detention. Owing however to the want of proper mimicipal 
regulations, in this country, to give eflSciency to the law of nations 
in such cases, I very much fear they will be suffered to depart 
unmolested. 

I was on yesterday permitted to read at the Department of State 
a portion of a Dispatch from Mr Green, dated at the city of Mexico 
the 20th. of August, last. He states, in substance, that since the 
arrival of a late Packet from England, the Mexican Government had 
changed its plan of attack upon Texas — ^That instead of an invasion 
by land they now contemplate an expedition by sea, which shall 
blockade Galveston, demolish the city, exterminate the inhabitants, 
and thus, at once, spread consternation and dismay through every 
part of our country. This to be done, immediately upon the arrival 
of their two Steamers from New York and those expected from 
Great Britain. 

I called yesterday upon the Secretary of the Navy and was informed 
by him that orders had gone to Commodore Connor to proceed forth- 
with with the vessels under his command, on a cruise to iixe Gtilf c^ 
Mexico and along our coast. How far the presence of such a force in 
the Gulf, in connection with the protest which the United States 
Minister at Mexico has been instructed to make to the Mexican Gov- 
ernment, concerning the renewal of hostilities at this time against 
Texas, a copy of which I presmne you will have seen before this 
reaches you, will deter the contemplated hostile movements of our 
enemy future events must determine. In my opinion there will be 
no serious invasion either by land or sea, it is wise, however, to be 
prepared for any emergency that may arise. 

It is not yet known, here, whether Mr Donnelson has accepted the 
appointment of Charg6 d 'Affaires to Texas, but it is presumed he has, 
and that he is now on his way to his post.

You have been appointed Chargfi d' Affaires of this Government to 
that of the United States and I have the pleasure to transmit you 
herewith your commission as such, your letter of Credence to be 
presented to the Secretary of State of that coxmtry, with a copy of 
the same ^ and also a full power to negotiate Treaties etc. 

So soon as it may be convenient it is desired that you will repair to 
the City of Washington and assume the duties of that Legation. Mr. 
Raymond is now in charge of its duties and has its archives, and will 
on your arrival resign the former into your hands and place at your 
disposition the latter. Among the Archives you will find instruc- 
tions for your governance. Others will be forwarded you from time 
to time from this Department 

The subject of most pressing and immediate importance, is that of 
the aid and protection to be rendered this country by the United 
States in the event of a resumption of active hostilities by Mexico, 
under the pledges and assurances given, previous to intering into 
negotiations for the Treaty of Annexation. Should the (Government 
of the United States not be wiUing to fulfill all those pledges in the 
most ample manner and to protect us both by sea and land, by the 
employment of a sufficient force in case of any hostile demonstrations 
on the part of our enemy, a knowledge of the fact must of course have 
a very considerable influence in determining the future policy of Texas 
in reference to annexation 

The unfortunate death of Gen Tilghman A. Howard the U. S 
Chargfi near this government has prevented my recieving the prom- 
ised copies of the instructions sent to him and to Qov. Shannon 
Charg6 to Mexico. I am consequently as yet ignorant of the precise 
course adopted by the Cabinet at Washington in reference to the 
appUcation made to it some time since for a redemption of those 
pledges, when invasion was threatened by Mexico. 

The President and Commissioners have returned from the Indian 
Council at Tawaccono Creek. A Treaty of Peace was concluded 
between Texas and, the Chiefs of the Commanches Wacos Caddos 
and several other tribes of Indians. The Commissioner on the part 
of the United States Capt Boone, unfortunately did not lurive in

time to be present at the Treaty. This circumstance was very much 
regretted by the President, and he used every effort to detain the 
Commanches untill Capt. B. should arrive but without success. They 
were very restless probably under some alarm for their personal safety, 
and would not wait. You will explain this matter to the Secretary 
of State of the U. S. and prevent any misconstruction being placed

Finding among the mstructions directed to this legation, by the 
Government of the United States, a despatch to the late CSiargfi 
d' Affaires, Grenl Murphy, in relation to a complaint against the col- 
lector of the customs at Sabine in Texas, growing out of his attempt 
to collect Tonnage duties from the United States Schooners Louisiana 
and William Bryan, under circumstances of threatened violence, 
which resulted in an agreement by the Masters of those vessels to pay 
said duties, if the two Governments should decide that they were 
legally imposed: and not perceiving from the records of the legation 
that the views of my Government on the subject, if communicated to, 
received the consideration of, this Government, I avail myself of the 
earliest opportunity since my arrival to soUcit your attention to it. 

You will perceive, from the papers, herewith transmitted, showing 
the circumstances and character of the transaction, that the authority 
to collect those duties cannot be recognized by the United States, 
without a surrender of their jurisdiction of the waters of the Sabine 
Pass, Lake and river — a jurisdiction clearly acknowledged by the 
Treaty of limits between the United States and Spain, and necessarily 
resulting from the admission of the boundary line, since run and 
marked by duly appointed commissioners on the part of both Texas 
and the United States 

Not supposing it can be intended to deny to the United States 
jurisdiction of the waters of the Sabine, from its mouth in the sea,

along its west Bank to the 32d degree of North latitude, as ascer- 
tained by the line referred to, it is presumed by my Government that 
this claim of tonnage duties was made without full consideration on 
the part of the collector, and without orders from the Government 
of Texas. 

The President of the United States, therefore, doubts not that a 
mere statement of the facts of the case to this Government will pro- 
duce such an order as will cancel the obUgation required of the Cap- 
tains of the Louisiana and William Bryan, and such instructions as 
will prevent hereafter a recurrence of like grievances. In conveying 
this expectation it cannot be necessary for me to dwell upon the 
tendency of such complaints to interrupt the friendly feeling between 
the citizens of the two RepubUcs, which it is so much the wish of the 
two Governments to promote, — or to make assurances of the deter- 
mination of my Government, in the exercise of its acknowledged 
rights, to obstain from every act which can be deemed questionable 
concerning the rights or even the feelings of the Government or people 
of Texas. 

I have the honor to be, with sentiments of great 

respect, your Excellency's very obedient servant

ICr^ Peyton to Mr. CacoUu. 

Office of the District Attorney. 

April 26th, 18U> 
Sm, 

I am in receipt of your letter of the 25th inst transmitting copies 
of the depositions of two American captains and their mates, in the 
coasting trade, who while in the waters of the United States, in the 
Sabine, were compelled by threats of having their vessels sunk, to 
land on the Texas side, and there pay or give their obligation to pay 
to the Texian officer of the Customs, one dollar per ton. That the 
said Captains are about to clear for the Sabine, and not wishing or 
intending to stop at a foreign port, request instructions and protec- 
tion from this office. And upon this subject you ask my opinion. 
This is a subject of grave importance, and one which more properly 
belongs to the Executive departments of the governments of the 
United States and Texas. 

According to the treaty of 22nd February 1819, and the third 
article thereof, the boxmdary line between the two coimtries (Spain 
and the United States) west of the Mississippi; shall begin on the 
Gulph of Mexico, at the mouth of of the River Sabine, in the sea con- 
tinuing North along the western lanTc of that river to the 32nd degree 
of latitude, thence by a line due North to the Rio Roxo or Red River. 
And all the Islands in the Sabine and the said Red and Arkansas 
rivers, throughout the course thus described to belong to the United 
States, but the use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine 
to the sea, and the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the 
extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks, shall be 
common to the inhabitants of both nations. 

From which it is clear that the United States own and hold sov- 
ereignty over the whole extent of the Sabine river up to the degree 
mentioned in the treaty and that it is a violation of her laws, and the 
rights of her citizens to molest or hinder them in the navigation of 
the waters of the Sabine river, under the circumstances mentioned. 

I think that you should extend all reasonable protection to Ameri- 
can vessels in the coasting trade, while navigating that river. The 
means to be used are to be determined on by yourself imder the 
advice of the Department at Washington. And in the meanwhile I 
would suggest the propriety of resorting to no course which may 
have a tendency to produce violence or bloodshed, xmtil the two 
governments of whose pacific and friendly disposition towards each 
other there can be no doubt, shall have an opportunity of giving 
instructions on the subject. 

I am, very respectfully, 

Your Obedient servant,

Dear Sm, 

The undersigned, Masters of the Schooners Louisiana and William 
Bryan, together ¥rith their Mates, do certify, that after having taken 
a cargo of Texas cotton on board, from Texas bottoms, while at anchor 
in the Sabine Lake, and in passing out of said Lake, we were forced 
to come to anchor by the firing of two large gims from the Texas 
Band,^ and demanded to pay one dollar per ton for the full tonnage 
of our vessels; and refusing to comply, were told by the Texas Col- 
lector that he would fire into, and sink us if he could. Having not 
Uie amount of any money with us to meet such demand and believing 
such to be no better than robbery upon the high sea, we made a 
written proposition, which the CoUector accepted. Accompanying 
this is a duplicate. Hoping to be protected by our government in 
the United States, we submit this to your consideration beUeving in 
the mean time you will protect us from further trouble, from the same 
source, imtil the final settlement by the U. States.

the American Schooner Louisiana, Daniel Eddy, Master, and William

To the Honorable 

Secretary of State 
Sm: 

I had the honor, on the 28th. ultimo, to receive your dispatch of 
the 24th. of October, last, notifying me, that the Hon. James Reily 
had been appointed Charg6 d'Affaires of Texas to the United States, 
and that he would probably reach this city about the l8t. of this 
month to enter upon the duties of his oflBice. He has not yet arrived, 
nor have I heard from him since the 10th. ult, when he was in Ohio. 

Enclosed herewith I transmit to your department a copy of the 
note of Mr Calhoun, Secretary of State of the United States, and my 
reply thereto, respecting the evidence required in the case of the out- 
rage committed by certain citizens of the United States upon the 
Collector of the District of Red River. This case, together with the 
Snively affair, has been brought to the attention of Congress in the 
President's Message, in order that the necessary appropriations, for 
the indemnity demanded by our Government, may be made; and it 
is hoped you wiU soon enable your Representative, here, to communi- 
cate the evidence alluded to, to this Government for the information 
and action of its Congress. 

I also enclose you a copy of the annual message of the President of 
the United States to both Houses of Congress,^ which was communi- 
cated to them on yesterday. It recommends, as I anticipated, the 
adoption of a joint resolution embracing the terms of the late treaty 
of annexation. 

It is altogether imcertain what will be the action of the present 
Congress on this subject, but I am firm in the belief that, if it remain 
unsettled until Mr. Polk comes in, he will, at once, convene an extra

to the outrage alledged to have been committed by certain citizens of

Sir, 

The undersigned Charg6 d'AfFaures of the United States, begs 
leave respectfully to invite the attention of the Honble Mr Allen to 
the ninth section of the act entitled an act supplementary to an 
"act to raise a revenue by import duties," whereby an additional 
duty of five per cent is levied on goods imported in American vessels 
in the ports of Texas. 

The undersigned anxious to improve the intercourse between 
the two Republics, and satisfied that the discrimenation in the act 
referred to, against the United States, whilst it lessens that inter- 
course is productive of no advantage to the revenue of Texas, would 
respectfully suggest that a further consideration of the subject may 
lead the Executive of Texas to take the same view of it, and, if so, 
result in a recommendation to Congress to modify the act so far as 
it relates to the vessels of the United States. 

The undersigned trusts that this suggestion will be received as a 
proof of the desire of the United States, to promote by all the means 
within their power an advantageous trade between the two countries, 
which is one of the surest bonds of their friendship, and he has the

ary 1841 the Committee on Finance estimated the public debt at 
$7,000,000. The appropriations for that year were in bonds bearing 
8 per cent interest, amounting in all to about $600,000, which, if I 
am not greatly mistaken, was less than the amount paid into the 
Treasury during that year. The expenses of Genl. Houston's late 
administration, have, as I understand, faUen short of the revenue 
collected in that period. In view of these facts I felt warranted in 
the statement which I made. 

As you will perceive, by an abstract of the proceedings of Congress 
contained in the newspapers which I have from time to time sent to 
you, several joint resolutions, having for their object the annexation 
of Texas to this Union, have been introduced into both the Senate 
and the House of Representatives, and refered to the appropriate 
Conunittees. Mr WeUer's resolution seems to meet with the most 
favor. It discards the consent of Mexico and the subject of slavery ; — 
matters which rendered Col. Benton's bill so exceptionable to many 
of the friends of the measure. 

The "Texas question'' will, according to previous arrangement, 
come up to day, in the House for discussion. I think Mr C. J. 
IngersoU of Pa is entitled to the floor. I will be particular in sending 
you the debates, for you doubtless feel great interest in all that con- 
cerns this vitally important subject. 

The recent correspondence between Mr Shannon, the United States 
Minister, in Mexico, and Mr Rejon, the Mexican Secretary of State, 
has ceased to excite much interest. It is supposed Mr Rejon wrote 
under the confident expectation that Mr Clay would be elected 
President of this Republic, and that his defeat will have a tendency 
to moderate the tone of the Mexican Government, and perhaps 
induce it to withdraw its insulting and highly offensive note. 

Colonel Reily has not yet arrived. 

I have the honor to be, with great consideration.

lution adopted by the Senate of the United States on the 16th. 
instant, calling on the President for information in regard to the pub- 
lic debt and the public lands of Texas, a copy of which accompanied 
your note." 

And in reply to the first inquiry, as to whether her public debt has 
been increased since the signature of the Treaty of Annexation in 
April, last, I have the honor to state that, from information and data, 
in my possession, procured from Official and other sources, I am fully 
persuaded, that her revenues since that period have equalled, if not 
exceeded, her expenditures; and that such has also been the case for 
the last four years. I have therefore no hesitancy in saying that her 
public debt has not been increased since the period referred to, except 
from the interest which has accrued upon a portion of it. 

In answer to the second inquiry as to whether there have been any 
additional grants of the public domain since April, last, I can only 
state that, if there have been any, they have not come to my knowl- 
edge. I know of but one law authorizing the Government to make 
grants of land, and that has been in force about four years. It 
authorizes the Government to issue land scrip, in redemption of its 
liabilities, at the rate of two dollars per acre. Only a few of the 
holders of these liabilities, have heretofore availed themselves of its

provissions. If however they hare done so within the last few months, 
the effect, as you will readily perceive, has been to decrease the public 
debt double the amount of the number of acres of land scrip thus 
issued. 

I have nothing further to add to the information heretofore com- 
municated to you by the Texian plenipotentiaries, Messrs Van Zandt 
and Henderson, in their note of the 15th. of April, last, on the other 
subjects embraced in the Resolution of the Senate, but will merely 
state, in explanation of the report of the Commissioner of the General 
Land Office of Texas, which was refered to in their note, that, in 
his general estimate of "Lands Appropriated," all the l^al or equit- 
able land claims however and whenever originated, for which the 
faith of that Republic stood pledged, are intended to be included.

The undersigned, Attorney General of the RepubKc of Texas,

and to enable him to present the matter with its incidents to the 
consideration of his Government, should he deem it expedient, so to 
do, the undersigned, subjoins a statement of the causes and cir-

industriously occupied in endeavouring to procure the sanction of 
Congress to certain projected measures, in the consumation of which, 
he has manifested strong personal interest, by availing himself of 
frequent private interviews with members of that body, to influence 
their public and legislative course, in aid of his favorites schemes. 
One of the projects thus originated and prepared by Mr. Green, was 
brought before the Senate, in the form of a bill for the incorporation of 
an institution, to be styled "The Texas Land Company,' ' — among 
the powers of which, imder a perpetual charter, was that of acquiring, 
holding and disposing of real estate to an unlimited amoimt — con- 
nected with those privileges and rights usually enjoyed by Insurance, 
Rail-Road, Life-Insurance and Trust Companies, and which consti- 
tute the peculiar and distinguishing features of such corporations; 
together with the power and capacity to monopolize the exclusive 
and perpetual use of all our navigable streams. 

Another was a plan for the charter of the "Del Norte Company," 
so to be called, also projected by Mr. Green, and designed to become 
a law by the action of the legislature, but which has not as yet been 
presented to Congress; — having in part for its object, the conquest 
and occupancy in behalf of Texas, of the Calif omias, and the Northern 
Provinces of Mexico, by means of an army aided by some sixty 
thousand Indian warriors, to be introduced from the United States 
upon our Western frontier." 

In furtherance of these schemes, and to obtain for them the for- 
malities and color of legislative sanction, Mr. Green, solicited the 
aid and influence of the Executive; and at an interview which he 
sought with the President at the Executive Department, on the 30th. 
ultimo, as well as on some previous occasions, he endeavored to 
induce His Excellency to exert his influence to effect the objects 
specified; first, — ^by an offer of portions of the corporate stocks of the 
projected companies; and, secondly, — ^by a threat to revolutionize 
the country and overthrow the existing government, in the event 
of His Excellency's refusing to accede to the proposal. 

Coupled with this threat, Mr. Green, took occasion to boast of the 
ease with which he could execute it; observing that the excitement 
among our citizens on the subject of annexation, manifested by the 
mass meetings of Matagorda and Brazoria, together with the alarm, 
which could be readily aroused by exhibiting to their minds the 
dangers to which our republican institutions would be exposed, in 
consequence of the great influx of Europeans into our territory, and 
the facility with which they would become entitled to the privileges 
of citizenfidliip, presented an inviting field for revolutionary operations. 

In consequence of these circumstances, the confidence before that 
time entertained by the President, in the fitness of Mr. Green for the

station assigned to him, as Consul, was necessarily destroyed; and 
His Ebccellency, however, regretting the emergency, was compelled 
in justice to his own convictions, to withdraw the Exequatur, referred 
to; believing that its continuance, not required by the principles of 
amity or courtesy which have ever distinguished the intercourse and 
relations of the two governments, would serve only as a false mani- 
festation of executive confidence, the existence of which had ceased; 
and that its revocation, not being inconsistent with any of those 
principles, presented in the present instances the mildest form for 
the expression of f^xecutive disapprobation. 

The President, being impressed with the belief, that the mode of 
proceeding adopted by him in this case, in reference to Mr. Green, is 
not susceptible of such a construction, as to render it in any degree 
objectionable to the Grovemment of the United States, directs the 
undersigned, to express to Mr. Donelson, the continued and earnest 
desire of His Excellency to preserve and promote the mutual rela- 
tions of concord and friendship which subsist between the two 
Governments, and the harmony which characterizes the intercourse 
of the citizens of each with those of the other, and his high personal 
esteem and regard for Mr. D.; in announcing which, the undersigned 
avails himself of the occasion to renew to Mr. Donelson the assurance 
of the distinguished consideration with which, the imdersigned has

CX)ERESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 335 

I have communicated this change of administration to the Secre- 
tary of State of the United States, with such expressions of friendship 
and consideration on the part of the President towards this Republic 
and its President as the occasion seemed to authorize. This, as you 
know, is the usual practice, and in accordance with the comity of 
nations; and as you gave no special instructions on the subject, I 
infered your wish that the usual course might be observed and pur- 
sued. I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of the communi- 
cation alluded to, which I hope Mrill be satisfactory to your Depart- 
ment. 

On yesterday I dined at the President's, and embraced the oppor- 
tunity to learn what were his own and his Cabinet's views in regard to 
the probability of a joint resolution for the annexation of Texas being 
passed by this Congress. They strongly incline to the opinion that 
such a resolution will pass both Houses the present session. 

The discussion of the question was opened on yesterday in the 
House by Mr Ingersoll, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign 
[Affairs], in an able and eloquent speech in its favor. The debate 
was continued to day but I have not had time to listen to it. The 
measure gains strength from day to day, and unless the Whig party 
cease their opposition and permit it to pass, it will grind them to 
powder. 

I have had no intelligence of Mr Reily since the 23rd. ultimo, when 
he was in Lexington, Kentucky. 

Hon. Ashbell Smith came passenger in the last Steamer from 
Europe, and I suppose is now in Boston or New York. 

I have the honor to be with assurances of my high consideration.

Duff Green Esqr on the 5th. October 1844, as consul of the United 
States for the port of Galveston. 

The undersigned will avail himself of the earliest occasion to 
transmit to his Government the explanation which has been fur- 
nished by the Honble Mr Allen of the transaction referred to, and is 
glad to perceive that it rests on causes, which, much as they are to 
be regretted, do not interrupt the friendly relations existing between 
the Governments of the two countries. Mr Green, soon after his 
arrival here, as bearer of despatches from Mexico, when questioned 
by the undersigned, as to the state of his consular duties, remarked 
that he was about to become a citizen of Texas, and having appointed 
a vice consul at Galveston, had informed his Government that he did 
not wish his name to be presented to the Senate of the United States 
for confirmation in the office, and that he would perform no further 
official act. Under these circumstances the undemgned did not feel 
it his duty to take cognizance of Mr Green's absence from Galveston, 
particularly as he knew that the duties pertaining to his office, in the 
present state of the trade between the two countries were very light 
even for a vice consul. It will be recollected also that previous to 
his late departure for New Orleans, the undersigned mentioned ver- 
bally to His Excellency the President of Texas that Mr Green had 
no authority in any manner to represent the Government of the 
United States. 

These facts are stated for the purpose of showing that Mr Green, 
although within the range of the responsibility imposed by an JSre- 
quatur from this Government, was practically only a new comer into 
Texas with the intention of acquiring the rights of citizenship. In 
this light then, the objectionable conduct imputed to him, ceases to 
have any higher importance than what belongs to his individual, pri- 
vate, character; and the undersigned is happy to be assured that his 
Excellency the President regards it as involving no interruption of 
those relations of amity and courtesy which in the intercourse of the 
Government and people of the two Republics, are so necessary to 
their reciprocal interest and welfare. 

As to the measures sought to be accomplished by Mr Green, under 
the authority and sanction of this Government, the undersigned feels 
it to be his duty to say that he had no knowledge of them, and par- 
ticipated in them, in no wise, directly, or indirectly, either as a public 
officer or as a private individual. Indeed those measures conflict 
essentially with the course of policy which the undersigned, if con- 
sulted, would have suggested as the most expedient for Texas at the 
present period. As the friend of reannexation he certainly couM not 
have the ight of a step, the effect of which would be to counte&imce 
the idea that the country between the Rio del Norte and the Pacific 
ocean v as to be invaded and severed by another revolution from

Mexico. To check such speculations — to give a more safe direction 
to the spirit of adventure abeady too much aroused by the weakness 
and short sighted policy of Mexico — and above all to secure to the 
people of Texas the blessings of peace and independence, under the 
guarantee of incorporation into the American Union, have been the 
aim and scope of all the counsel which the undersigned has ventured 
to offer. 

Any policy which would raise new issues, which would entangle 
Texas in new enterprises calling for further aid in money or munitions 
of war, would be contrary to what the undersigned has supposed to 
be the wish and interest of Texas, because it would add new impedi- 
ments to the success of the measures yet necessary to secure rean- 
nexation to the United States, and jeopard in other respects her 
ability to maintain her present elevated position. 

The undersigned having felt it his duty to make these observations, 
begs leave to add that he will submit to Mr Green the reasons for the 
revocation of the Exeguatur, under the hope that some explanation 
consistent with his honor and acceptable to his Excellency the Presi-. 
dent, will be made by him, not on the public account, but that impu- 
tations so deeply effecting his standing may be removed if they appear 
not to be merited 

Appreciating highly the personal regard expressed for him by the 
President, the undersigned begs leave to say in reply to the Honble 
Mr Allen, that it is most sincerely reciprocated, and he trusts will 
continue to uphold him in the performance of all his duties near this 
Government; and the undersigned begs Mr Allen to accept for him- 
self also assurances of his high consideration and regard

26th.<» and 27th of November last, and of the 4th. ulthno: — the latter 
enclosing a copy of the annual message of His Excellency, the Presi- 
dent of the United States, and also copies of the note of Mr. Calhoun 
Secretary of State etc. and your reply to the same, on the adjustment 
of the difficulties originating in the CoUectcuial District of Red River; 
and the evidence to be furnished by this Department to the Depart- 
ment of State of the United States, to estabhsh the facts of the case, 
and the amount of damages sustained by this Government in conse- 
quence. The purport of that portion of His Excellency's Message, 
which treats of the relations existing between the two Grovemments, 
and of measures, in the opinion of His Excellency, best calculated 
to secure and hasten the annexation of Texas to the United States, 
are regarded with approbation by the Executive of this Republic; 
who perceives with feelings of peculiar satisfaction, that the sugges- 
tions and views of His Excellency, Mr. Tyler, contained in the mes- 
sage referred to, correspond with the elevated and ingenuous poUcy, 
which has preeminently distinguished his administration, whenever 
its influence could be properly brought to operate upon the affairs 
and interests of Texas. Although the fond hopes fcomerly enter- 
tained and frankly expressed by the citizens of the latter country, 
that the Star Spangled banner of our father land would this day, wave 
over them, have been checked and deferred: — ^yet, be the final result 
of the negotiations tending to such a consummation, what it may; 
the able and distinguished efforts of His Excellency's administration 
to secure the rich and abiding fruits, sure to grow out of annezaiion 
effected upon a proper basis; and to enure mutually and reciprocally 
to the benefit of both countries, will ensure to Mr. Tyler the lasting 
gratitude of the people of Texas. His policy of annexation may or 
may not attain its object, depending for success as it does upon the 
contingent and uncertain modification and harmony of conflicting 
interests and opinions, beyond the control of either government and 
inseparable from the republican institutions of each; but in its tri- 
umph or defeat, Mr. Tyler and his distinguished supporters in the 
cause of annexation, will receive, as a mede [sic], if inferior to their 
high deserts, still, it is hoped, not worthless in their estimation, the 
enduring tribute of a nation's thanks. Your reply to the enquiries 
so frequently addressed to you by Members of Congress and others 
in the United States, relating to the present views of this government 
in regard to annexation, as communicated in your private dispatch, 
under date of the 17th. ultimo,^ the receipt of which the President 
directs me to acknowledge, meets his entire approbation; and was 
conceived in terms corresponding with the existing relations and the 
state and progress of the negotiations between the two governments,

touching that subject. Should the present session of the Federal 
Congress pass by without fixing upon some definite, tangible and 
eligible mode for carrying into effect the projected scheme of annexor 
lion, it is highly probable that the people and Government of Texas, 
yielding to the natural influence of disappointment, and to an irre- 
sistable reaction consequent upon procrastination, would feel com- 
pelled to consider their connexion with the measure dissolved. 

The evidence required by Mr. Calhoun touching the case before 
referred to, will be furnished by this Department at its earliest possi- 
ble convenience, and will, as I trust, be forwarded in season for the 
necessary action of the Congress of the United States upon the sub- 
ject, at the present session. In as much, however, as all the witnesses 
conusant* of the necessary facts, reside some four hundred miles 
distant from our Seat of Government, some time must necessarily 
elapse before the requisite testimony can be obtained and forwarded.

Department of State, 
Washington [Texas,] 16th. Jan'y 1845^ 
Sm, 

A letter from Messrs L. H. WiUiams and B. Sloat, Indian Agents 
in the service of the Government, addressed to Major Thos. G. West- 
em, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, under date of the 6th. Jan'y 
inst., has just been laid before the Executive; from which, it appears, 
that the two children of Mrs Simpson, stolen by Indians from Austin, 
on the Colorado early.in November last, are now in the possession of 
the Waco and Toweash or Wichita Indians, encamped in the Wichita 
mountains, about 550 miles northerly from this City; in the Territory 
of the U. States. 

The agents above named were sent out, immediately after the news 
of the outrage reached the ears of the President, for the purpose of 
seeking and recovering those children from their Indian captors; but 
having reached a point some 200 miles above this place, they foimd 
it impossible to proceed; — the prairies for hundreds of miles across 
which they must travel, being at this season, destitute of grass, and 
furnishing no food for their horses. They will recommence their jour- 
ney so soon as the grass shall spring up, and will reach Fort Towson 
early in the spring. Congress has by a Joint Resolution approved 
on the 31st ultimo, appropriated and placed at the disposed of the 
President the sum of $300 for the redemption of these captive children.

The President directs that you communicate this intelligence to 
the government of the United States and request the aid of its authori- 
ties to effect the release of the prisoners through the agents or other- 
wise, from the Indians, and cause them to be conveyed to Fort Tow- 
son or some other point where they can be delivered to our agents and 
restored to their home and friends. All necessary expenses attend- 
ing a cooperation on the part of the authorities of that government 
to recover those captives, will be promptly paid if within the appro- 
priated amount, and should it exceed that amount, a sufficient sum 
will be no doubt appropriated to meet the excess. 

The prisoners are William, a son and Jane, daughter, of Mrs Simp- 
son, a widow lady residing at Austin — The former about twelve and 
the latter about fourteen years of age. 

The tribe with which the Wacos are encamped in the mountains 
are known indifferently as the Toweaah or Wichita Indians, and it is- 
hoped that the foregoing information, with such assistance as the 
President doubts not will be cheerfully accorded by the Government 
of the U, States, will lead to the speedy release of tJiese youthful cap- 
tives from their savage masters, who delight to aggravate rather than 
relieve the afflictions and sufferings of their prisoners.

I George W. Wright a citizen of Lamar County in the Republic

do upon my oath depose and say that in the latter part of the month 
of March A. D. 1843 I was in company with Messrs. Timms, Burtho-

Texas, and for that cause had been seized by Capt. James Bourland, 
Collector etc. 

That those gentlemen being interested in obtaining the release of 
the goods applied to me to aid them in so doing by advice and by 
becoming security in any bond or obligation to the Government of 
the Republic which might be necessary to effect the legal release of 
the goods. They informed me that the value of goods, wares and 
merchandize, so seized, amoimted in the aggregate to the siun of 
about fifty thousand dollars. I understood from those gentlemen and 
have learned from many others acquainted with the transaction, that 
the facts and circumstances attending the illegal introduction of said 
goods, their consequent seizure by the Collector, Mr. Bourland, and 
their subsequent forcible taking, and removal by Capt. Scott and 
others, citizens of the U. States, were substantially the same as 
related in the accompanying Deposition of Mr. Bourland himself — 
which I have carefully perused and examined.

The Deposition of James Bourland; Collector of Customs for the 
Red River District, co[m]posed of the Counties of Fannin, Lamar, 
Bowie and Red River, with the late Judicial County of Paschal. 

I, James Bourland, being first duly sworn upon the Holy Evangel- 
ist of Almighty God, do upon oath depose and say, that on or about 
the fifteenth day of March A D 1843, certain goods, wares and mer- 
chandise, as herein after described, were imported and introduced 
into the Republic of Texas, at a place in the County of Red River and 
in the Collectoral District aforesaid, situate upon the southerly bank 
of Red River, called Brierly's landing — also known by the name of 
Rowland. The said Goods wares and merchandize were imported 
from some port or ports in the United States, upon a Steam Boat 
called the Fort Towson — the same being a foreign vessel owned by 
citizens of the United States, and were landed at the time and place 
aforesaid by the officers and crew of said Steam Boat, who proceeded 
to store and deposit the same in a certain ware house there; — that no 
stress of weather or misfortune, or emergency existed as this deponent 
believes to cause the same to be so landed and stored; but that the 
said Steamboat — immediately there afterwards, departed for the pur- 
pose of receiving another cargo at some place further down the said 
River, and in the United States, with which to return; — that, although 
there was an officer of the customs in the immediate neighborhood of 
that place, at that time, still no report was made to him by the Officer 
in command of said Steamboat as required by the Revenue Laws of 
Texas, nor were the impost duties prescribed by those laws paid or 
tendered, before or after the landing and depositing of said goods, 
wares and merchandise as aforesaid: — that afterwards, on or about 
the twenty-sixth day of March 1843, I, the said deponent, believing 
that said goods, wares and merchandise had been introduced into the 
territory of this Republic in violation of the revenue laws thereof, and 
that the same were concealed in said ware house, procured a warrant 
from the proper Judicial authority, and by virtue thereof proceeded to 
search for said goods, wares and merchandise — and accordingly f oimd

the same in the warehouse, where they had been deposited as afore- 
said; — whereupon I seized the same in accordance with the laws in 
that behalf, and instituted proceedings in admiralty, to the end that 
the said goods, wares and merchandise might be proceeded against, 
condemned and disposed of according to law. 

That the said goods, wares and merchandise so foimd and seized by 
me as aforesaid — consisted of the following articles and packages, and 
are in other respects as follows — viz: 

[Here follows the inventory.^] 

And I, the said Deponent, do further state the necessary expenses 
incurred in the premises, and in taking charge of said goods, wares 
and merchandise, and in the necessary examination, removal, and 
repacking of the same in the discharge of my Official duty, consequent 
upon such seizure — amounted to the sum of one hundred dollars; and 
that the aggregate value of the said goods, wares and merchandize 
was, at least fifty four thousand dollars, as appeared from the exami- 
nation and from the fullest and best information that I could obtain 
from the owners and traders interested in the same. 

And I, the said Deponent do further declare and say, that about 
the eighth of April 1843, while I was in lawful possession of the said 
goods, wares and merchandise, at Rowland aforesaid, Captain Joseph 
Scott, commander of the Steamer Fort Towson aforesaid, together 
with the crew of said boat, aided by a part of the hands employed on 
the Steam Boat "Hunter," consisting of from thirty to forty men, all 
of whom were citizens of the United States — came suddenly upon me 
and having thrown me violently upon the ground, they proceeded to 
tie and confine me with a rope, which they drew around my arms, 
shoulders and legs, so as to prevent me from rising, keep me in a 
prostrate condition on the ground and utterly prevent the use of my 
limbs. At the same time they, with insults and abusive language, 
took from my person, my brace of pistols, knife and keys and carried 
them on board the boat. In the mean time Capt. Scott himself who 
had the command and direction of the crowd, and who is a resident of 
Arkansas, stood over me armed with a gun, several others of his 
crew also standing about armed with Guns, while the remainder by 
his order proceeded to the ware-house, broke the door from its hinges, 
and conveyed all the goods, wares and merchandize aforesaid, on 
board of the Steamboat Fort Towson — then at the landing; after which 
Capt. Scott and his crew went on board the boat and immediately 
put oflf. 

In relation to the amoimt of damages sustained in consequence of 
the forcible seizure and taking away the said goods, wares and mer- 
chandize, under the circumstances before mentioned, I the said

deponent can remark that I cannot pretend to suggest the proper 
rule for estimating these damages. 

The aggregate value of the property forcibly seized and taken away 
from my possession as aforesaid by Captain Scott and others, citizens 
of the United States cannot in my opinion fall short of fifty four 
thousand dollars. The expenses incurred by me attending my ofl&cial 
seizure of the goods etc., as above mentioned, cannot be fairly esti- 
mated at less than one hundred dollars more, — and the damages sus- 
tained in my own person by reason of the indignities so offered me as 
aforesaid, while in the lawful discharge of my Official duties, I will not 
attempt to estimate, but will leave this item to the decision of the 
authorities interested in the final adjustment of the affair between the 
two countries.

The undersigned, Chargfi d' Affaires of the United States, has the 
honor to submit herewith to the consideration of the Honble Mr 
Allen, Attorney Gtenl of Texas, and charged ad interim with the 
Department of State, a letter from Duff Green Esqr., in relation to 
the objectionable conduct imputed to him, and which was the subject 
of the communication made to the undersigned on the 4th. Inst 
by the Honble Mr Allen. 

Accompanying this letter is also one addressed to Mr Green by 
three Gentlemen of this place. The object of both letters is to shew 
that Mr Green, however understood by the President, did not intend 
to misrepresent him, or influence improperly his conduct.

This voluntary disclaimer on the part of Mr Green of all intention 
to wound the feelings of the President or interfere in any manner 
with the conscientious dischai^e of his official duties, it is hoped, 
by the undersigned, will justify a withdrawal of the personal imputa- 
tion on his character and produce a restoration of the friendly rela- 
tions which would otherwise have continued to exist between them. 

The undersigned r^rets deeply that his confinement to the bed 
of sickness, from which he is yet hardly able to rise, has so long post- 
poned this explanation; but he is happy to say that he has in the 
interval received evidences of the most satisfactory nature that the 
disclaimer offered by Mr Green is not only sincere, but is consistent 
with the exposition, which a closer examination has afforded of the 
measures proposed to be accomplished by him through the agency 
of this Government, and in the interviews respecting which originated 
the misunderstanding between himself and the President. 

Of the opinion entertained by the undersigned of those measures, 
he does not deem it necessary on this occasion to say more than 
was suggested in his note of the 6th. on the subject. His object 
here is simply to be the medium of explanation for Mr Green, being 
satisfied that the President will take great pleasure in withdrawing 
personal imputations on his character, whenever he is satisfied that 
they are not deserved. 

The undersigned renews to the Honble Mr Allen the considerations 
of high regard and esteem with which he continues to be his 
Most Obedient sevt

Dear Sir 

I have read the copy of the letter from the Secretary of State giving 
the reasons for the revocation by the President of Texas of the 
Exequatur, under which I acted as consul.** Nothing was further 
from my intention than to offer the slightest disrespect to him, or 
to resort to any improper means to obtain his sanction for the meas- 
ures to which he refers, and I trust that as an act of justice to us both, 
you will disclaim for me all intention to offer the slightest disrespect 
or to interfere in any manner with the consciencious and independent 
discharge of his public duty. 

I need not say to you that the measures referred to, as presented 
by me, were believed to be proper and expedient. My purpose is not 
to discuss them but to enable you to make the most unequivocal 
disclaimer and to put my intentions properly before the President

I do this ns an act of justice to mjself leaTing hixn to act ns he may 
think proper. 

My letter of the 2nd. of January, published in the Telegraph ** was 
written under an apprehension that the President had intentionaly 
sought a quarrel without cause, and that altho an effort was then 
making to bring about a reconciliation it would not be accomplished. 
It was but natural that under such circumstances I should yield to 
the suggestions that he was, in fact, opposed to annexation and was 
acting under the advice of the British Minister. Yet you will see, 
by reading that letter, that I do not make the charge, but reserve 
my opinion subject to his future action. 

That letter was placed in the hands of the Editor of the Telegraph, 
not to be published unless it became necessary for my vindication. 
When I heard that in an interview with you the President indicated 
a willingness to do me justice I would have written to Houston to 
prevent its publication, but found upon inquiry that it was too late 
for an express to reach there in time. I regret its publication, as 
from the assurances received through you, I am satisfied that injustice 
has been done to the President.

to which you allude. The conversation turned on the subject of 
annexation. The first of the undersigned spoke of the mass meetings 
which had lately been holden in the counties of Matagorda and Bra- 
zoria, and of the expression of opinion in his section of the country, 
that the President, heads of Departments and foreign Mmisters were 
all opposed to annexation. You expressed the decided belief that 
our Executive would not oppose a proposition from the United States 
for the annexation of Texas, which she ought [to,] or could accept. 
You further expressed the opinion that the recognition of Texas Inde- 
pendence by Mexico, without annexation, would be followed by the 
abolition of slavery in this country in five years. 

The first of the undersigned then stated that he had been among 
the first "to put in motion the ball of revolution" in Texas; that 
rather than submit to such a state of things, he would be willing to go 
into another revolution. You inquired * ' how " ? One of us responded 
'*by a convention of the people", to which the first gave his assent 
You still persisted in the expression of your belief that, the offer of 
such terms of annexation as Texas ought or could properly accept 
would meet with the Executive approval.

Sm, 

I beg leave to call your attention to a claim, upon the Government 
of Texas, held by William B Lewis, Esqr. 2d Auditor of the Treasury 
of the United States. It is founded on an advance of money made 
in the winter of 1836-37, to the escort that accompanied Genl 
Santa Anna to Washington City under the authority of this Gov- 
ernment. The escort being out of funds were under the neces- 
sity of obtaining a loan at the Metropolis Bank of $1500 which 
was effected through the instrumentality of said Lewis as an endorser 
of their note. The liability to the Bank was duly met and paid by 
the endorser. 

As the endorsement was made on the faith of this Government, 
whose honor was involved in the transaction, it is believed that it

constitutes a claim which will be recognized with pleasure. It is 
understood to have been promptly acknowledged at the time by 
President Houston, who would have paid it but for the want of means 
in the Treasury. 

The subject is now submitted to the consideration of the Executive, 
with a hope that under his protection and recommendation, it may re- 
ceive such a disposition as will secure relief to the worthy citizen who 
so generously offered his credit to sustain an appeal made to him in 
behalf of Texas.

Department op State, 
Washingtony [Texas,] 2l8L Jan'y 1846. 

The undersigned, Attorney General of the Republic of Texas, 
charged, ad interim, with the direction of the Department of State, 
has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the note addressed to 
him, on yesterday, by the Hon. A. J. Donelson, Charg6 d' Affaires of 
the United States, relating to the ** objectionable conduct" recently 
imputed to Duff Green, Esq., originating in his interview with the 
President, enclosing Mr. Greens letter to the Hon. Mr. Donelson, 
under date of the 20th. inst., and the copy of a communication from 
three Gentlemen of this place to Mr. Green — the two latter having 
relation to the same subject, containing a disclaimer on his part to 
offer *'the slightest disrespect" to the Executive or to interfere in 
any manner with the conscientious and independent discharge of his 
public duty; and manifesting the desire that the Hon. Mr. Donelson 
should so present the matter to the President as to place before him 
in a proper point of view the intentions of Mr. Green. 

Towards that gentleman, Mr Donelson cahnot but be perfectly 
aware that the course pursued by His Excellency resulted alone from 
a sense of the official obligations incident to his station — in adopting 
which, he neither entertained nor was in any degree influenced by 
motives of private pique or personal unkindness; and the under- 
signed having submitted the note of the Hon. Mr. D. and its accom- 
panying communications, to His Excellency, has the satisfaction of 
announcing, in reply, that His Excellency, accepts the disclaimer of 
Mr. Green, coming as it does with the explanations in his behalf, 
which the Hon. Mr. Donelson has presented. 

A necessity for giving color to suspicions prejudicial to any indi- 
vidual, of wounding his feelings, or in any degree interrupting his 
private relations in society, be the justification ever so apparent or

COBEESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 351 

the duty ever so imperative always prevents an alternative to be 
regretted by the ingenuous and the honorable. Alive to such feel- 
ings, His Excellency is happy to avail himself of the occasion to obvi- 
ate, so far as the tenor of the correspondence referred to will warrant, 
the injurious effect of any imputations resting upon the private char- 
acter of Mr. Green resulting from a possible misunderstanding of the 
motives which actuated him in his interviews with the Executive; 
who as the undersigned is instructed to inform Mr. D. is willing to 
beUeve that he may have misapprehended the intentions of Mr. 
Green, and that his designs were in fact as expressed in the language 
of his disclaimer. 

The President duly appreciates the honorable motives which 
induced Mr. Donelson to become the medium of explanation, as 
stated in his note, for Mr. Green, but in announcing this acceptance 
of the explanation thus offered and the proposition, suggested by the 
Hon. Mr. D. in the matter under consideration, the undersigned must 
be permitted to remark, that he is happy to perceive from the letter 
of Mr. Green that he regrets the pubUcation of his communication 
addressed to the Editor of the Telegraph under date of the 2d. 
instant, and the acknowledged injustice [which] has thereby been 
done to the President. The apparent charge conveyed by the lan- 
guage of that article that the Executive was opposed to annexation 
and was acting under the advice of the British Minister, requires no 
remark from the undersigned, as he conceives, to obviate any unfavor- 
able impressions which such a chaise would be calculated to make 
upon the mind of Mr. D. — or to convince him of its fallacy and injus- 
tice. The state of the negotiations pending between this government 
and that of the United States, the evidences of which are in Mr. D's 
possession would furnish to such a charge even if seriously made, a 
sufficient refutation: Mr. Greeny however, in his letter communicated 
vnth the note of Mr. D., to the undersigned, denies making such a 
charge — ^which would in fact have been wholly at variance with his 
own repeated declarations as stated in the letter of the three gentle- 
men, before alluded to, bearing date only one day before that of his 
communication to the Telegraph, a copy of which is reUed upon as a 
part of the explanation submitted in his behalf. 

The recovery of Mr. Donelson, from recent severe illness, affords to 

His Excellency an occasion of sincere joy and congratulation, in which 

the undersigned most cordially participating, renews to Mr. D. the 

assurance of the high regard with which he has the honor to remain 

His Most Obedient Servant.

Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit to you copies of 
the note of Mr Calhoun, Secretary of State of the United States, of 
the 22nd. instant, and the Resolution of the House of Representatives 
which accompanied it, and also my reply to the same. 

I also send you a copy of the Joint Resolution declaring the terms 
on which Congress will admit Texas into this Union as a State, 
which passed tlie House of Representatives of the United States 
on the 25th. instant by a vote of 120 to 98, Several whig members 
voted for, and several nortliem democrats against it, so that it was 
not passed by a strict party vote. The northern democrats who 
voted against it, at the same time expressed themselves favorable to the 
measure of annexation, but desired further restrictions with regard 
to slavery. It will in my opinion pass the Senate by a smdU majority ; 
and be approved by the President of the United States. The door 
will thus be opened for our admission into this great and glorious 
confederacy of states; and it will remain for Texas to say whether 
she will become a State of this Union and upon what terms and 
conditions. If we but let the slavery compromise stand as the 
Joint Resolution leaves it, I am well satisfied that the next Congress 
which convenes at this Capitol, will agree to almost any terms we 
may name.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of the 
10th ultimo; and am gratified that my reply, as communicated in my 
private dispatch of the 17 th of December, last, to the inquiries so 
frequently addressed to me by members of Congress and others in 
this coimtry relative to the present views of our Government in regard 
to annexation, meets the approbation of the President. 

A majority of the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate 
reported on the 5th. inst; against the Joint Resolution for annexa- 
tion which had previoudy passed the House of Representatives. 
Their principal objection was the unconstitutionaUty of the proposed 
mode of admitting Texas into the Union; they however suggested 
no other method for its accomplishment, but recommended that the 
whole subject be laid on the table. 

On yesterday, Col. Benton withdrew his former bill for the annexa- 
tion of Texas; and offered a substitute for the same. I herewith 
enclose you a copy of his substitute, which after some alterations, or 
perhaps as it now stands, will probably meet the approval of three 
fifths of the Senate. 

I have the honor, also, herewith to transmit you a copy of the 
note of Mr. Calhouns, Secretary of State of the United States, of the 
22nd. ultimo, in reference to two Texan boys who were captured by 
Indians, and supposed to be among the Wichitaws, within the United 
States, and of my reply to the same of this date. 

Mr. Calhoun is just recovering from a severe attack of pneumonia.

Calhoun, Secretary of State of the United States, of the 22nd. ultimo, 
informing him of the measures taken by the Government of the 
United States for the recovery of two Texan white boys, who were 
supposed to be in captivity among the Wichitaw Indians, within the 
United States, and of the fact, that, after a careful examination 
through the village inhabited by that tribe, the persons making the 
search became satisfied the boys were not in possession of the 
Wichitaws. 

The Government of the Undersigned will be gratified to learn of the 
earnest eflforts so promptly and willingly made by the Government 
of the United States for the recovery and restoration of the two boys 
to their kindred and coimtry ; and although those efforts have, as yet, 
failed in effecting their humane purpose, they nevertheless furnish 
renewed evidence of the friendly disposition of the Government of 
the United States, towards the Government and people of Texas, 
and of its determination to fulfill, in good faith, its treaty stipulations 
with that country. 

As there is a rumor, perhaps well founded, that the boys are held 
as captives by Eackapoos or Comanches, Indian tribes inhabiting the 
territory of the United States, the Undersigned entertains the hope 
that the Government of the United States will not relax its efforts 
until the place of their captivity be discovered and they be safely 
delivered into the hands of their friends. 

The Undersigned avails himself of this occasion to offer Mr Calhoun 
renewed assurances of his high consideration.

has the honor to acknowledged the receipt of the note of the Hon. 
A. J. Donelson Charg6 d' Affaires of the United States of America, 
bearing date the 2d Deer. 1844. together with the accompanying 
documents, in relation to a complaint made against the Collector 
of the Customs at Sabine in Texas, inasmuch as this officer required

the payment of tonnage duties from certain American Teasds resort- 
ing to the port of Sabine for commerce. ^The right of every nation 
to make those interior regulations respecting commeroe aad navi- 
gation which it shall find most convenient to itaelf and to reserve 
to itself the liberty of admitting at its pleasure other nations to a 
participation of the advantages of its commerce, is a doctrine which 
has received the solemn and repeated sanction of the American 
Government, and will not, it is presumed, be controverted by the 
Hon. Mr. Donelson. On this clear principle the Government of 
Texas may of right establish the conditions on which they wiU 
admit other nations to come to their shores and receive the products 
of their soil or carry on commerce with their inhabitants; and they 
may require as one of the conditions of vessels trading with their 
port of Sabine the payment of dues or tonnage duties 

The town of Sabine in Texas is a commercial fori; the adjacent 
country along Sabine Bay is washed by navigable waters; and the 
whole is subject to all the uses and incidents appertaining to a coast 
bordered by navigable waters. The port in question cannot be 
used except as a party a marUime depot, for ordinary commercial 
purposes, neither can it by any fiction be regarded in any other light. 
If Sabine be not used as a port it cannot be used for commercial pur- 
poses at all; and the GoVt of Texas, as already intimated, may 
require as one of the conditions on which they will allow foreign 
vessels to trade with this port, the payment of tonnage duties; and 
if the payment of these duties be refused may bring to all vesseb 
so refusing and compel payment. Relatively to this point, the under- 
signed begs to cite Mr Jefferson who in 1792, then Secretary of StaCe 
under General Washington declared in a commimication on a matter 
similar to the one now imder discussion that, **the right to use a 
thing comprehends a right to the means necessary to its use and 
without which it would be useless." And this doctrine has been 
since explicitly asserted by all the American text writers on Inter- 
national Law and solemnly affirmed and acted on by the American 
Government. If moreover the use of such means be refused on a 
plea of ** jurisdiction" or the use so shackled by unnecessary regu- 
lations as to render it unavailable by Texas, it then becomes an injury 
of which Texas may demand redress. 

If the Government of Texas do not possess the right to collect 
tonnage dues and establish the other customary regulations of 
commerce for the port of Sabine, then have we at Sabine the most 
absolutely free port in the world, and there exists no authority 
any where to regulate or supervise the commerce that may be carried 
on thereat. The undersigned does not suppose that the Hon. Mr 

a Opposite the beginning of this sentence in the margin are written the words, " Treatf between Fmdob 
and the United States of 1778, preamble."

Donelson on the plea of ''jurisdiction" would claim for his Gov- 
enunent the right to establidi a custom house at the Sabine to regu- 
late the commerce of the port, thus making the soil of Texas appur- 
tenant to the water which washes its shores. The authority to regu- 
late the commerce of the port in question must exist somewhere. 
The undersigned believes it is vested in the Nation owning the terra 
•firma. Custom Houses are established on Vmi and not on the 
waUr although their operation extends over the water. 

If the ri^t contended for by Texas exist at all, it is and must of 
necessity be exercised as a 'perfect right, otherwise it would be utterly 
nugatory. It would be idle to establish regulations for the commerce 
carried on upon its coast, if vessels in sight and even within short gun 
shot of the shore may openly set at naught or evade those regula- 
tions. And a limited jurisdiction for this purpose must be exercised 
by Texas over the adjacent waters. 

So bold an evasion and flagrant a violation of the revenue laws 
of Texas as has been attempted by the averment that the commerce 
between the shore and foreign bottoms has been carried on by means 
of flat boats or keel boats, will not surely be justified by the Hon Mr. 
Donelson. To prevent Uke audacious frauds, England and the 
United States claim and exercise for this special purpose a jurisdic- 
tion of twelve miles from their coasts respectively, within which 
distance they will not allow such fraudulent trans-shipments to be 
made. 

By the terms of the Treaty of 1819, made between Spain and the 
United States, renewed in 1828, between Mexico and the U. States 
and finally established in 1838 between Texas and the United States, 
as the basis for running the boundary line, without any change of 
language so far as relates to the boimdary and the waters of Sabine 
Bay; it is declared that the ''use of the waters and the navigation" 
of the Bay are common to the inhabitants of both countries. This 
stipulation is declaratory of the right of Texas to the use of the 
waters in question, and is as clear and essential a portion of the Treaty 
as that which establishes the boimdary line along the Western bank 
of these waters. 

The undersigned has entered into a brief argument above to show 
on soimd principles of public law and from the necessity of the case, 
that a harren use was not intended — a bare permission to sail in and 
out of Sabine Pass — but a beneficial use for all things which may be 
lawfully done on shore. If foreign vessels resort to the port of 
Sabine to receive the products of Texas, the Nation owning the land 
and this nation alone, can impose tonnage duties and if necessary 
can go upon the water to enforce the collection of them by virtue of 
their right of use solemnly recognised in the Treaty in question. It 
would be violative of the best established of all rules of interpreta-

tion, so to interpret the ^* jurisdiction" as to exclude the use; both 
rights repose on the same basis and are not incompatible; effect 
must therefore be given to both. No incompatibility or conflict 
can arise, inasmuch as the United States cannot claim to establish 
custom houses at the port of Sabine nor collect duties upon Texian 
soil on the products shipped or foreign merchandize imported there; 
To do these acts appertains of right exclusively to Texas on princi- 
ples of public law and by the provision of the Treaty of Boundary. 

The Undersigned cannot therefore admit the opinion exprrased 
by the Hon Mr Donelson that ''the authority to collect these duties 
cannot be recognised by the United States without a surrender of 
their jurisdiction of the waters of Sabine pass, Lake and river"; on 
the contrary he conceives that the Government of Texas have a 
perfect right to collect these duties and to the "use and navigation" 
of the waters in question for this purpose, and their collection does 
not conflict with the just claims of the United States nor afford that 
Government any good cause of complaint. He cannot believe that 
the Government of the United States propose so to stretch the inter- 
pretation to be given to their ''jurisdiction" as to sustain their citi- 
zens in violating those laws which the people of Texas may legiti- 
mately establish, as a condition of commerce with them. 

The undersigned embraces this opportunity to present to the Hon. 
Mr Donelson assurances of the high consideration with which he has 
the honor to be.

desired by this Government. The Hon. D. S. Kaufman has been 
appointed Minister Charg6 d' Affaires of this Country to reside near 
the Government of Washington on the Potomac and will proceed to 
his post early in the spring. It is the wish of H. E.^* the President 
therefore that as soon as may be convenient after the 4th of March 
you take leave of the American Government in the customary 
manner, and return to Texas, unless the interests of this country 
should render it expedient to delay for some short time your departure. 
I am also instructed by the President to express to you his entire

with the manner in which you have executed the duties devolving

have received publications made by order of Parliament of great 
value. Should a proper occasion present itself, you can intimate 
verbally to the Secretary of State that this Gov. would willingly 
make a similar exchange of public documents with the United

under direction of Congress would be highly useful to us.

by copies of my notes to Mr. Calhoun, Secretary of State of the 
United States, of the 10th and 11th instant, herewith eiiclosed. 

On the 11th instant the Department of State submitted the testi- 
mony of Messrs Bourland and Wright to the Committee of Ways 
and Means of the House of Bepresentatiyes, in order that the neces- 
sary appropriation may be made by Congress to meet the demands 
of our Government, which I cannot doubt will be done. 

I understand, from the Secretary of State that the Department 
of War, to which the case of Mrs. Simpson's children has been referred, 
will adopt the most active and efficient measures to procure the 
release of the captives and their restoration to friends and country. 
I will forward you a copy of the orders of the War Department 
touching this matter so soon as I shall be furnished with them. 

The President and Vice President elect arrived in the City on Thurs- 
day last. On Saturday I paid my respects to them and met with 
a warm and cordial reception from both. 

The Senate has not yet acted on the Joint Resolutions for the 
annexation of Texas. Their discussion will probably consume the 
whole of this week; but if the friends of annexation in the Senate 
will, even then, unite upon the House resolutions, or a similar plan, 
the measure can and will be carried the present session.

The undersigned, Charg6 d' Affaires ad interim of the Republic of 
Texas, by direction of his Government has the honor to transmit, 
herewith, to Mr. Calhoun, Secretary of State of the United States, the 
depositions of James Bourland, Collector of customs for the Red 
River District, in Texas, and George W Wright, a citizen of Lamar 
county and Senator in the Texian Congress, in relation to the seizure, 
in March 1843 by said Collector, of certain goods introduced into that 
Republic in violation of her revenue laws, by citizens of the United 
States — the subsequent forcible rescue of those goods by the importers 
and their abusive treatment, at the same time, of the person of the 
Collector — all of which has heretofore been the subject of correspond- 
ence between the two Governments.** 

The depositions are properly authenticated before the Hon M. P. 
Norton, Judge of the District Court of the 6th Judicial District of 
Texas; and establish most clearly the facts of the illegal introduction 

a For the depositions of Bourland and Wright, see Allen to Raymond, January 20, 1845.

of the goods, their forcible seizure and taking away by citizens of the 
United States; and, as near as possible under the circumstances, the 
amount of damage suffered in consequence. 

The evidence being full and explicit, covering all ihe points sug- 
gested in Mr Calhoun's note of the 2nd. of December, last, to the 
undersigned, on this subject; and the whole case having been fully 
examined and discussed, the undersigned can at present, see no 
obstacle to its speedy, final and satisfactory adjustment — an event 
which he hopes soon to have the pleasure of communicating to his 
Government.

(Mr. Raymond to Mr Calhoun.) 

Legation of Texas 
Washington February 11th I84S 

The undersigned Charg6 d' Affaires ad interim of the RepubUc of 
Texas, has the honor to inform Mr Calhouh, Secretary of State of the 
United States, that Major Thos G Western, Superintendent of Indian 
Affairs of Texas, has received, under date of the 6th ultimo, a letter 
from Messers L. H WiUiams and B Sloat, Indian Agents in the service 
of that RepubUc, from which it appears that the two children of Mrs. 
Simpson, a widow lady — the one a son named William, about twelve, 
and the other a daughter named Jane, about fourteen years of age, 
who were stolen from their motheris residence at Austin on the Colo- 
rado river, in Texas, early in the monlh of November, last, are now 
in the possession of the Waco and Toweash or Wichita Indians, 
encamped in the Wichita mountains, about 550 miles northerly from 
the City of Washington, Texas, and within the territory of the United 
States. The tribe of Indians, with which the Wacos are encamped 
in the mountains, is known indifferently as the Toweash or Wichita. 

Messrs Williams and Sloat were sent out immediately after the 
news of the capture reached the ears of the President for the purpose 
of seeking and recovering these children from their Indian captors, 
but having reached a point some two hundred nailes above the said 
City of Washington, they found it impossible to proceed. The 
prairies, for hundreds of miles across which they must travel, being 
at that season destitute of grass, and furnishing no food for their 
horses. They, however, ascertained the facts stated in their letter, 
to Major Western, from the Comanches and other friendly Indians, 
whom they met in their travels and at Torrey^s trading house, as well

as from their personal observation and knowledge of the course and 
character of the Indians committing the outrage. These agents will 
reconmience their journey so soon as the grass shall spring up, and 
will reach Fort Towson early in the Spring. 

In view of the foregoing facts, the undersigned is directed by his 
Government, formally, but most respectfully, to request of the Gov- 
ernment of the United States the aid of its authorities to effect the 
release of these prisoners and their safe conveyance to Fort Towson 
or some other point, where they can be deUvered to the Texian 
agents, and thus restored to their home and friends, as provided in 
the 33rd article of the Treaty of 1831. 

The hope is confidently indulged that the efforts of the Texian 
Agents, seconded by the powerful assistance, which the President of 
Texas doubts not will be cheerfully accorded by the Government of 
the United States, will lead to the speedy release of these youthful 
captives from their savage masters; and while engaged in accom- 
plishing this humane object, it is not improbable that the two boys 
mentioned in Mr Van Zandt's note of the 10th of August, last, who 
were captured by the Indians on the Trinity river in the early part of 
last year, but whose place of captivity the agents of the United 
States have hitherto been unable to discover, may also be found and 
restored to their country. 

The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to offer Mr Calhoun 
renewed assurances of his distinguished consideration

inst. and the documents which accompanied it, in reply to my note to 
him of the 1 1th. inst., in which I requested the interposition of his Gov- 
ernment in effecting the liberation of the two children of Mrs Simpson 
from their captivity and their restoration to their own country; and 
also suggested that further inquiries and efforts be made, at the same 
time, for the discovery, release and safe return to their home and 
friends of the two boys who were captured by Indians in the early 
part of last year on the Trinity, and supposed to be held as captives 
by Indians within the territory of the United States. 

I deemed it unnecessary, in my communication to Mr Calhoun, to 
state that our Grovemment would defray the expenses incurred in 
''the transmission and maintenance" of the children should they be 
fortunately recovered, because this is fully understood and provided 
for in the 33rd. article of the treaty of 1831. 

The Government of the United States, as you will perceive by refer- 
ence to the orders given, has evinced a laudable disposition to carry 
out in good faith its treaty stipulations with our country, and mani- 
fested a most conmiendable anxiety for the welfare of the captive 
children. 

Some of the friends of annexation in the Senate are in favor (for 
the purpose of strengthening the measure and adding to their forces) 
of attaching to the joint resolutions of the House Col Benton's propo- 
sition, as a proviso, to go into effect only in case Texas should refuse 
to accede to the terms expressed in the proposition which has passed 
the House. I succeeded on yesterday in ascertaining, to my entire 
satisfaction, that all essential differences among the democratic 
Senators had been removed, and that they will come up to the support 
of the measure of annexation in one solid phalanx, and that a suffi- 
cient number of whig Senators will unite with them to carry it. The 
only question among them seems now to be, whether they will adopt 
the joint resolutions as they passed the House, with perhaps some 
slight and not very material alterations, or pass them with Col 
Benton's proposition attached as a proviso. With the vote of Senator 
Foster of Tennessee either plan could be carried, but I understand he 
objects to the proviso proposed, and unless he yield, the joint resolu- 
tions of the House must be passed pretty much as they now stand. 

It is understood that the President elect is exceedingly desirous 
to have the question settled the present session of Congress; and that 
letters have just been received here from Gov Wright and Ex Presi- 
dent Van Buren of New York urging immediate annexation. Col 
Benton seems disposed to yield, to some extent, his own views to 
those of the great body of his party. In a conversation I had with 
him, on yesterday, he stated that he entertained not the slightest doubt 
of the passage of the measure at this session to admit Texas as a State 
into this Union.

Information reached here yesterday, which is believed by many to 
be authentic, that the new Government of Mexico had intercepted 
and communicated to Congress a dispatch from Santa Anna to the 
British Minister, by which the astounding fact was disposed that he 
had entered into a treaty vvith Great Britain, transfering to her the 
two Califomias. But being made without authority and in violation 
of the Constitution the treaty cdbnot, of course, be binding on the 
Mexican Nation. 

If we are to credit the testimony of the ''London Times" and the 
''Havre Journal,'' England has made overtures to France to unite 
with her in measures to prevent the annexation of Texas to the

I beg to call your attention to the exchange of official docimients

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 
16th Instant stating that ''the absence of the Hon A. J. Donelson 
Charg6 d' Affaires of the United States near the Ck)vemment of Texas 
having created that kind of emergency which authorizes Consuls of 
the United States to communicate with the Grovemment of Texas'', 
and calling my attention to matters touching the collection of duties 
by the Collector at Sabine on American vessels resorting to that port 
for commerce. 

I beg to state in reply that this subject will be attended to on the 
part of Texas immediately on the return of the Hon the Charg6 
d' Affaires of the U. States to his post near this Government. Mr 
Newell is undoubtedly aware that a discussion of this matter at the 
present time would be without any useful object, 

I take this occasion to mention that the Chief Clerk of this Depart- 
ment to whom has been entrusted the collection and forwarding of 
the late Hon T. A. Howard's effects, got the same into possession 
yesterday, and that he will forward them without delay, by the first 
safe means, of doing so.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of

been appointed Minister Chargfi d'AflFaires of Texas to reside near 
the Grovemment of Washington on the Potomac, and granting me 
permission to return home as soon as convenient after the 4th. 
instant, unless the interests of Texas should render it expedient to 
delay for some short time my departure. Had I consulted my own 
inclination, I should not have failed to take advantage of the per- 
mission to return, but in view of the posture of our aflfairs in respect 
to annexation, I thought it proper and expedient, and therefore my 
duty, to remain at my post imtil I should learn the determination 
of the Government concerning the overtures, which had been made 
to it, by this Government, through Major Donelson its Charg6 
d'AflFaires, for the annexation of Texas to the American Union, unless

for this Grovemment to hold some correspondence with the Texian 
Representative here upon the subject. In these views Mr Walker, 
Secretary of the Treasury, coincided fully and expressed his strong 
conviction of the importance of my remaining. Under these circum- 
stances I have, with some inconvenience to myself, prolonged my 
stay here and purpose, unless I receive instructions to the contrary, 
to postpone taking my leave of this Government until I hear the 
result of the overtures alluded to; and inasmuch as the resolutions 
for annexation passed the Ck)ngress of the United States after the 
date of your despatch and perhaps unexpectedly too, I have thought 
my determination to remain a short time longer would meet the 
wishes and approbation of the Government. 

Your expression of the President's entire satisfaction with my 
efforts to accomplish annexation, and generally with the maimer in 
which I have executed the duties devolving on me as Acting Charg6 
d'Affaires of Texas, has caused me the highest gratification. 

Shortly after the receipt of your despatch I had a conversation 
with Mr Buchanan in regard to an exchange of public documents 
between the two Grovemments. He said as soon as the press of busi- 
ness consequent upon the commencement of a new administration 
was over he would take pleasure in furnishing us with the collection 
of "American State papers'' and other public documents, if there 
were any such under the control of his Department. 

On Friday last; I had an interview with him at the Department of 
State, and among other things mentioned the Snively and Red River 
cases,** and requested him when he should reply to my note to Mr 
Calhoim of the 10th. ultimo, communicating the evidence in the last 
named case, to inform me what disposition had been made of them 
by Congress, and especially whether or not any appropriation had 
been made for the payment of the indemnity claimed in those cases 
by the Texian Government To which he remarked that his time had 
been so much occupied in Cabinet Council and in receiving and decid- 
ing upon applications for office that he had been unable to take up 
any of the back business of his Department, but assured me that on his 
return from Pennsylvania, where he is going this week to remain 
only a few days, he would examine into the cases refered to and com- 
municate to me their condition. I understood from the Committee 
of "Ways and Means," to whom was refered the correspondence 
and evidence in those cases, that no report whatever was made 
thereon, assigning as a reason the lateness of the period at which 
they received the evidence. 

I have succeeded in collecting togetiier a mass of valuable public 
documents, comprising reports of Congressional Committees, Heads

Legation op the United States, 

Wdshington, TexaSj April 7, 1846- 

The imdersigned, Charg6 d'Aflfaires of the United States, has the 
honor to acknowledge the receipt of the communication from the 
Hon. Ashbel Smith, Secretary of State of Texas, dated the 10th of 
February last, but not delivered to the undersigned until his recent 
arrival here. 

This communication is an answer to the note of the undersigned, 
dated the 2d. of December last, in relation to the attempt of the 
Collector of the Customs on the west bank of the Sabine, to exact 
duties from the schooners Louisiana and William Bryan, vessels 
belonging to the United States, and navigating the waters of the 
Sabine river and feay, under the circumstances stated in that note; 
and suggesting the expectation that this Government, not apprized 
of the construction of powers under which that collector had acted, 
would issue such instructions as would hereafter prevent such infrac- 
tion of the rights of vessels of the United States. But it appears 
that the conduct of this ofiicer is justified. 

To the general observation made by the Hon. Mr. Smith, in open- 
ing of his remarks on this subject, claiming for Texas the right to

establish such regulations as she may think proper, respecting her 
conunerce and navigation, within her own waters and jurisdiction, 
the imdersigned cheerfully assents. This is a right conceded to all 
independent nations, and is the necessary consequence of sovereignty. 
But it was not in derogation of this right, that exception waa taken 
to the codiduct of the Collector on the Sabine. It was, that that 
collector, within the jurisdiction of the United States, claimed the 
right to extort duties from vessels not bound to a port of Texas, but 
sailing within the waters of the United States, and charged with no 
maritime tort, either to Texas or any other nation. 

If said vessels had sailed to Galveston, or any of the bays, inlets, 
or rivers of Texas, this complaint would not have been made, and the 
obedience due to the revenue laws of Texas, would have been readily 
admitted. As far as the jurisdiction of Texas extends, it is undoubt- 
edly exclusive and absolute, and no restriction can be placed upon 
it without her consent; because such restriction, if imposed by 
another power, would be, to that extent, an acknowledgment that 
such power was her superior. Such is the law of nations, as under- 
stood and enforced by all enUghtened governments. 

What is the effect of these principles, appUed to the claim in ques- 
tion, when it is conceded that the jurisdiction of the United States 
extends to water mark on the West bank of the Sabine, and from 
thence to the sea? The undersigned cannot suppose that argument 
can make more plain the conclusion which the mere statement of the 
principles so obviously presents. 

But the Hon. Mr. Smith is of opinion, that the treaty which secures 
to the inhabitants of Texas the use of the waters of the Sabine would 
be a nullity, if the right to collect the tonnage duties in question 
did not result. Such could not have been the understanding of the 
two high contracting parties to the treaty; tor the same clause which 
gives to the respective inhabitants of the two nations, the common 
use of the waters of this boundary for the purposes of navigation, 
expressly cedes the exclusive jurisdiction of the same to the United 
States; nor is it likely that such is the imderstanding of the inhab- 
itants who enjoy this right, and who, but for this stipulation, might 
have been at any time deprived of it by the United States. 

Not is this construction of the treaty altered, in the judgment of 
the imdersigned, by the declaration of Mr. Jefferson that " the right 
to use a thing comprehends the right to the means necessary to its 
use, and without which it would be useless". This language has 
reference to the condition in which the inhabitants of the valley of 
the Mississippi would have been placed by a denial to them of the 
right to navigate this river to and from its mouth — a right enjoyed 
by them both before and after the revolution which established the 
independence of the United States, and which was never abandoned.

though its relinquiahment wa3 ctften iiisisted upon by the powers 
poaaeesing juxisdiotioik of tJie river south of the point where it left 
the boimdary (tf the United Statea> until the purchase of Louisiana. 
But 13 thare an analogy between this right and that now dauned by 
the Hon. Mr. Smith, for the enforcement of revenue regulations on 
th'e waters of the Sabine? Texas, standing in the place of Spain, 
does not deny the competency of Spain to part with her jurisdiction 
over the Sabine. Mr. Jefferson, in maintaining for the United States, 
a claim to the free navigation of the Mississippi, never asserted that 
the United States eouH not relinquish it. Texas possesses this right 
oi navigation by cctntract as the representative of Spain, and is 
bound in the e:2(ercise of it, not to interfere with the jurisdiction of 
the United States. Mr. Jefferson never claimed the right to make 
the vesaeJb of France or Spain pay tonnage duties at the mouth of 
the Miasiasippi, until the United States possessed jurisdiction there. 
Texas daims this right at the mouth of the Sabine, admitting at the 
same time that ahe has no jurisdiction there, and when it is obvious 
that the jurisdiction neoesaaiy to give the power to enforce this right 
was withheld, in order to avoid just such difficulties as those whidi 
now exist and which are inaeparaUe from the concurrent authority 
of two separate nations over the same subject. 

According to the treaty referred to, under which the respective 
rights of Texas and the United States on the subject of limits, are 
defined, and by which courts, having jurisdiction of all maritime 
torts, happening on the waters of the Sabine, must be governed, Texas 
has no commercial port on that river, in the sense in which the Hon. 
Mr. Smith treats it, as a place where commercial regulations can be 
enforced by her on the waters thereof. To the existence of such a 
port there must not only be ownership of soil but jurisdiction of water. 
And it would be as unsound to derive this right of jurisdiction from 
the inconvenience attending the want of it, as it would be for an 
individual possessing only a limited estate in lands or other property 
to claim the fee simple or superior title, because with this title he 
could the better control the use. Spain voluntarily gave up this supe- 
rior title, and was content to stipulate for the limited one for the the use 
of her inhabitants. For vaUd and satisfactory considerations, she sol- 
emnly agreed that the *' terra firma" of Texas, on the Sabine, should 
be the limit of her jurisdiction, which should include neither the 
islands nor the waters of that river. Yet, in opposition to such treaty 
stipulations, it is contended that the moment Texas chooses to build 
a house at Sabine in Texas, and to call that house a port, this juris- 
diction becomes subservient to that of the land. The language of the 
Hon. Mr. Smith is, that ''he does not suppose the Hon. Mr. Donelson, 
on the plea of jurisdiction, would claim for his Government the right 
to establish a custom-house at the Sabine, to regulate the commerce

of the port — thus makmg the soil of Texas appurtenant to the water, 
which washes its shores. The authority to regulate the commerce of 
the port in question must exist somewhere. The undersigned believes 
it is vested in the nation owning the terra firma. Custom houses are 
established on land and not on vxiter, although their operation extends 
over the water." 

The diflBculty in the mind of the Hon. Mr. Smithi will disappear, 
the moment he perceives the misapplication he has made of terms. 
It is not by calling Sabine in Texas a port, that it becomes one in the 
full commercial sense. There must be jurisdiction of water as well 
as of land; otherwise, the custom house located there will be as 
unavailable as the medium of enforcing revenue duties from vessels 
of the United States, using the water under the terms of the treaty, 
as if it were one hundred miles oflF, in the back country. Within her 
jurisdiction, above water mark and on the land, Texas is competent as 
stated before, to establish such rules and regulations as she may 
choose to prescribe — she may say that there shall be no import 
or export, to or from her territory, without the payment of duties at 
that house, or any other house on the terra firma, next to the Sabine, 
and she may arm the collector with authority to enforce her regula- 
tions; but these regulations become inoperative the moment they 
assume an authority over the waters of the Sabine, or interfere with 
a jurisdiction which is independent of hers, and is absolute and exclu- 
sive over those waters. It cannot then be a question, that the author- 
ity to regulate commerce on the waters of the Sabine does not belong 
to Texas; nor can it be doubted that all regulation not incompatible 
with the right of the inhabitants of both countries to the common 
use of those waters, for the purposes of navigation, necessarily belongs 
to the United States, since it can belong to no other nation without 
an infringement of the sovereignty acquired by the treaty of 1819, 
with Spain. 

But for the sake of testing the soundness of the argument advanced 
by the Hon. Mr. Smith, let it be supposed that the United States, 
instead of acquiring exclusive jurisdiction over the Sabine to its 
mouth in the sea, possessed only an equal one with Texas. Would 
the vessels of the United States even then be Uable to the exaction 
as claimed in the present case? The undersigned thinks not. The 
terra firma of the east bank would have as many rights as the terra 
firma of the west bank; and the law of nations respecting the rights 
of both as equal, would limit the respective jurisdiction of the two 
countries to the middle of the stream, estimated from the low water 
mark of the respective banks. So that, if the schooners Louisiana 
and William Bryan had been anchored on the east side of this line, 
and had there received from Texan boats their cargoes, it is not

perceived that the right to levy the duties in question could be 
enforced against the consent of the United States. 

The undersigned is willing to admit, but without instructions from 
his Gk)vemment on the subject, that a commercial convention 
between the two coimtries might be framed, with great advantage 
to both, which would obviate such grievances as the present. It is 
but right that Texas should have some convenient mode of prevent- 
ing the introduction into her territory, on the bank of the Sabine, of 
foreign productions, without the payment of the duties which are 
collectable at her ports of entry on the Gulf of Mexico, or elsewhere 
within her jurisdiction. It is equally important to the United States, • 
that every avenue should be closed, as far as possible, against the 
receipt into their ports of the productions of Texas, which are now 
doubtless often shipped to New Orleans, and other points in the 
Union, without any mode of identifying them by the revenue officers 
as the growth or production of Texas. The revenue of each country 
thus suffers; but the existence of such an evil does not confer upon 
Texas the right claimed for her by the Hon. Mr. Smith, to correct it 
upon her own terms, without the consent of the United States and in 
defiance of their jurisdiction over the waters of the Sabine. 

The undersigned indulges the hope that the views he has here 
expressed, will be satisfactory to the Hon. Mr. Smith and to this 
Gk)vemment: So far at least as td make manifest the propriety of 
issuing such instructions to the collector at Sabine, as will prevent 
the recurrence of similar grievances to the one complained of. Pend- 
ing the consideration of the proposals, now before this Gk)vemment 
for cementing the relations of the two RepubUcs, by the bonds of a 
common union, it is particularly desirable that no differences of this 
nature should occur to disturb the feelings or prejudice the interests 
of the citizens of either country. And if the undersigned has created 
even a doubt in the mind of this Government, relative to the justice 
of the claim maintained for the collector, in regard to those tonnage 
duties, he tru[s]ts that for the present at least, its enforcement will 
not be attempted. 

He has the honor to express to the Hon. M. Allen assurances of the 
high respect and regard, with which he is his most 
obt. hbl. servt.,

COBRESPONDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 375 

26th, instant, the Hon Ashbel Smith en route to Europe. We trav- 
elled together to within ten miles of Baltimore. He designed sailing 
from Boston in the Packet of the 1st. proximo. From my conversa- 
tion with him I am led to expect that the next mail from Texas will 
bring something definite in regard to the progress of annexation, 
though the GoveHmient seems to be pursuing, as it should do upon 
a subject of such deep and vital interest to the welfare of our infant 
Republic, a cautious, prudent and considerate course. Some there 
are in this and our own coimtry who are disposed to censure the Presi- 
dent because he will not rush heedlessly, recklessly and without 
deUberation right into the arms of the United States, but such men 
do not stop to reflect upon the fearful responsibility which rests on 
the Chief Magistrate of a nation when called to act upon a question in- 
volving such mighty consequences and so pregnant with weal or woe 
to the destinies of his coimtry. Whatever is done should be well done. 

In a conversation with Mr Buchanan, Secretary of State of the 
United States, on yesterday, concerning annexation, I expressed the 
opinion the whole question would probably be refered to the decission 
of the people of Texas and that their verdict would doubtless influence 
the coxurse and policy of our Gtovemment in its final determination. 
He replied that such a course could not be objected to, but at the 
same time expressed great anxiety for speedy action. 

A collission between this country and Mexico appears almost inevi- 
table. Her efforts will probably be directed, mainly, against the 
conmierce of the United States. This Grovemment is preparing 
for the emergency and when the crisis arrives they will be ready to 
meet it. It is imderstood, here, that Mexico has proffered us the rec- 
ognition of oiu* independence on condition that we never become a 
part of the American Union. If this be so, her extreme sensitiveness 
on the subject of annexation must proceed from hostility to the 
United States, and she is placed in a rather imenviable, suspicious 
and double faced attitude. 

I have not a particle of doubt that a large majority of the next Con- 
gress of the United States will be favorable to annexation, and I am 
strongly of opinion a treaty for that object would be ratified by the 
Senate. 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a despatch from 
your department dated the 21st. ultimo, in reference to the two 
children of Mrs Simpson stolen by the Comanches; and in obedience 
to instructions have communicated the facts in their case to this 
Government, altho' it had been inf o[r]ma}ly advised 0f the same Bever al 
weeks before. Enclosed herewith I transmit you a copy of my com- 
munication of this date on ibe subject, to the Secretary of State.

Washington [City] May 19tJi. I84B 
Sib 

Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit to you a copy of 
my communication to Mr Buchanan Secretary of State of the United 
States, informing him of the acceptance of my resignation and my 
permission to return home;^ and of his reply to the same. 

I had a parting interview to day with the President and Secretary 
of State. They were considerably elated by the recent news from 
Texas, and expressed great gratification at the favorable prospect of 
annexation, and assured me that nothing should be wanting on the 
part of the Executive of this coimtry towards ensuring to Texas her 
just rights after she shall have become a member of this Confederacy 

On last friday evening I had the pleasure of a long conversation 
with the President in regard to annexation. He is of opinion, the 
wisest and safest course for Texas to pursue is to accede, at once, to 
the terms of the Joint Resolution, as proposed, and trust to the jus- 
tice, honor, and magnanimity of this nation to correct whatever 
injustice may have been done to Texas by the Act of Congress. Ho 
has no confidence in the Whig Senators, on this question, and conse- 
quently believes it would be endangered by a treaty. He remarked 
there would not, probably, be a war between this country and Mexico 
growing out of the annexation, nor did he apprehend any difficulty 
with Great Britain on this or the Oregon question, nevertheless the 
Government of the United States would maintain the ground it had 
taken on these questions towards those countries. He asked if I had 
any doubts about the acceptance by the Government and people of 
Texas of the proposition for annexation now before them. I told 
him frankly and unhesitatingly that I entertained none whatever — 
that they had all along been in favor of the measure, and that one of 
the first acts of President Jones was to inform me that the annexation 
of Texas to the American Union was a measure earnestly desired by 
the Government, and to instruct me to use my most strenuous exer- 
tions in every proper manner for its accomplishment.

The only matters now pending here are the Snively and Red River 
cases. I learn, upon inquiry, that Congress made no provission for 
the payment of our claims of indenmi[fi]cation in the cases alluded 
to — the reason assigned is that the evidence was not furnished in 
time for examination and action. I presume there will be no diffi-

of Congress. 

I shall leave here to morrow morning for Cincinnatti, Ohio, where 
I shall stop a few days and then proceed to Washington, Texas, where 
I expect to arrive about the meeting of Congress.

COBRESPONDENCB WITH THE UNITED STATES. 883 

• 

the salutations of His Excellency the President of Texas, with the 
assurance of his fneoidly dispositions and cheerful cooperation in 
carrying out and perfecting^ the policy and measure of AnnMsoa&m 
according to the terms of the adopted and pending basis. 

In the existing attitude of relations between Texas and the United 
States, the strong necessity for the utmost good understanding, 
unity of purpose and mutual confidence between the Executive Gov- 
ernments of the two countries, will naturly suggest itself to your mind. 
However confident each of the interested Powers may be in the antici- 
pation of a speedy and propitious union of the two countries; and 
notwithstanding the consent of the existing Government of Texas 
in its Executive and Legislative branches^ and the consent of the 
Delegates in convention, have been given to the proposition; still it 
should not be disguised, that the consummation of the measure is not 
yet secure from the dangers of defeat, even in this country. 

There are many secret but influencial (^posers of the measure, who 
have been borne along by the current of popular excitement, ostensi- 
bly extending to it their support, but who are awaiting only an oppor- 
tunity to resist and defeat it. 

Matters of local interest and subjects of irreconcilable discord, 
incentives to partisanship, intrigue and disorganization are attempted 
to be pressed upon the Convention, tending to revolution instead of 
annexation^ and threttening to incorporate in the projected constitu- 
tion, matters incompatible with the principles of the Constitution of 
the United States. 

These considerations evince the importance of perfect concert and 
harmony of action, and of coincidence and cooperation of purpose, 
no less than prudent circumspection, on the part of those respectively 
charged with the administration of the two Governments. 

The Policy pursued therefore, by the Executive of Texas pending 
negotiations touching annexation, towards the Governments of Eng- 
land, France and Mexico, should be understood and appreciated by 
the American Cabinet. 

The many misrepresentations that have been industriously circu- 
lated both by the press and by designing individuals in both coun- 
trieSy are calculated to lead to error; but the President would not do 
that Cabinet the injustice to entertain the supposition that any of its 
members can have consented to receive impressions from such sources. 

When the overture for annexation was communicated on the part 
of the United States by their Charg6 d' Affaires, the Hon Mr Donel- 
son, to this Government on the 31st of March last, the latter had 
long been on terms of friendly national intercourse with the sov- 
reignties of England and France, whose diplomatic agents were 
then residing near this Government. That overture in view of the 
President, created no cause or excuse on the part of Texas, for an

abrupt termination of that intercourse. To its continuance, the 
presence of a diplomatic agent of this Republic at the Courts of 
London and Paris, was necessary; and Mr Smith, who had then but 
recently returned from Europe, was sent back to resume the function 
of Charg6 d' Affaires of Texas, some time suspended by absence from 
his post, and by the Senate's rejection of the appointment of Mr 
Terrell. The intercourse of Mr Smith with those Courts, imder the 
instructions of the Executive, has doubtless had an effect to reconcile 
their Sovreigns to the policy of annexation. But, aside from this 
consideration, the usages of national courtesy and comity required 
such a measure on the part of the Executive of Texas; especially at 
a juncture, when a change in the policy of the country, not favored by 
the European Powers, was about to take place; in order that the 
proper explanations concerning the course of the authorities and 
people of Texas might be seasonably made to those Powers. 

Mr Smith having satisfactorily performed the duties of his mission, 
was recalled early in June ultimo. 

The good offices of England and France to obtain a recognition 
of the independence of this Republic from Mexico, had been solicited 
and obtained by the Executive of Texas, long before the adoption 
by the American Congress, of the Joint Resolution, proffering the 
alternative and defining the basis of annexation to the Federal Union. 
Among the high obligations to the community imposed upon the 
Executive by the very tenure of his official charge, that of securing 
OrcJcnowledged independence to the nation, with its incidents of quiet 
and freedom from the distresses of frontier and marauding warfare; 
protecting the industry and nascent resources of the country from 
the paralising influence of threttened hostilities; and securing to the 
Republic additional dignity and elevation in the scale of nationality, 
was paramount; and one, for the violation of which, no dispensation 
could prevail. Surely the impression cannot obtain, that the arrival 
from the United States of the proposition for annexation, however 
welcome to the authorities and people of Texas, could operate to 
discharge her Executive from the performance of a duty so impera- 
tive, as that of using his best efforts to secure an acknowledgment of 
her independence from Mexico. Negotiations to gain that acknowl- 
edgment and to procure the consent of the United States to the 
measure of annexation, had long been simultaneously carried on. 
Never was it supposed that those negotiations aimed at the attain- 
ment of objects, incompatible with each other: and the Executive 
conceives that his course would have been most censurable, cir- 
cumstanced as the country then was, if he had failed to use every 
honorable means for the accomplishment of each and both those 
objects. 

The acceptance of a proposition for annexation necessarily referred 
itself to the decision of the nation, not to that of the Executive; and

the Chief Magistrate, having it in his power to present to the nation 
such a proposition from the United States, along with a recognition 
of its independence from Mexico, was no more at Hberty to withhold 
the one than the o(her. The people were entitled to choose between 
the two alternatives. 

Impressed by such considerations the Executive in March last, 
placed at the disposal of the representatives of France and Great 
Britain, upon their renewal of the offer of the good offices of those 
Powers with Mexico, for a peaceful settlement of the difficulties 
between the two republics, upon the basis of her acknowledgment 
of the independence of Texas, with the imderstanding that the latter 
would maintain her separate existance; — a statement of conditions 
preliminary to a treaty of peace. 

These conditions were subsequently acceded to by Mexico, and 
remitted to this Government through the diplomatic functionaries 
of France and England. 

Upon their reception, the President issued his proclamation to the 
People of Texas dated the 4th of Jime last; wherein are stated the 
''circumstances which preceeded and led to that understanding with 
Mexico, " and the principles which influenced him in the transaction.^ 

From that Proclamation (a copy whereof is enclosed for reference) 
it will be seen that the Executive, on placing in the hands of the 
British and French Ministers, the preliminaries referred to, declared 
his readiness '' to submit them to the people of this coimtry for their 
decision and action, as soon as they were adopted by the Government 
of Mexico; '' — that those functionaries and their respective Govern- 
ments were emphatically reminded," that he was no more than the 
agent of the people; — that he could neither direct, control, nor influ- 
ence their decision; and that his boimden duty was to carry out their 
determination constitutionally ascertained and expressed, be it what 
it might; " — that our Representative at the Courts of France and 
Great Britain was specially instructed to press upon the attention 
of those Governments, that, if the people of Texas should determine 
to put an end to the separate existence of the country, the Executive, 
so far as depended upon his official action, must and would give 
immediate and full effect to their will." 

The inconsistency, illiberaUty and injustice of charging that any 
measure of poUcy hitherto adopted or pursued by the Executive 
originated in a spirit of hostiUty to the cause of annexation, it is 
believed are now manifest. The good offices of England and France 
had been invoked and conceded; — the imwillingness of those Powers 
to see Texas meige her nationality was imderstood; the President 
in accepting their invited intervention; in reminding them that its 
results were to be submitted to the decision of the nation; in impress-

ing at the Courts of Great Britain and France, that, to choose between 
a distinct national existance, and incorporation with the Umon, 
was alone the prerogative of the Texian people; in receiTing and pre- 
senting for their choice those aUemativeaf as proffered by the United 
States on the one hand, and by Mexico on the other: — has but 
acted in that spirit of impartiality and justice, which the relations 
of Texas with each of those several powers impelled him to assume; 
animated at the same time by an earnest desire faithfully to dis- 
chaige his official obligations towards the people of this Republic. 

In the exercise of their right, the people have so manifested their 
decided preference for annexcUion over the correlative proposition; — 
a preference deriving higher merit from the acknowledged vahie of 
the rejected aJiemative; — that the Executive conceives he would 
prove recreant to his trust, should he not exclusively devote his 
energies to a prompt and faithful consimunation of the measure of 
annexation, according to the terms of the pending overture. 

You will fully communicate the proceeding views and sentiments 
entertained by the Executive, to the President of the United States; 
and assure His Excellency of his readiness and zeal to cooperate in 
any measure calculated to hasten and secure the Union of the two 
Republics. 

You will keep this D^artment didy informed of your proceedings, 
and of all matters important in your judgment to be communicated

that the Deputies of the People of Texas assembled in Convention at 
the City of Austin on the 4th. Instant, and adopted on that day an

This assent given with promptness and with much unanimity

Sir 

Advices have reached this department that the Hon David S. 
Kauphman -^is sick at Nacogdoches, and that some weekg may elapse 
before he will be able to repair to his post as Chargfi d'Affaires of 
this Republic at the City of Washington. It is hoped that his con- 
finement will be of short duration, and that he will soon be able to 
assume the discharge of his official functions. 

But it is deemed necessary in the mean time that this Government 
should be represented by a proper diplomatic agent near the Grov- 
emment of the United States. 

By virtue of your appointment as Secretary of Legation, you are 
authorised to discharge the duties of Acting Qiarg6 d' Affaires in the 
event of the absence of the principal officer from his post; and it is 
deemed advisable by the President that you enter upon the discharge 
of those duties, upon your reaching Washington unless the arrival 
of Mr Kauphman may be relied on in course of one or two weeks 
in which event you are to be governed by your own discretion under 
the circumstances of the case. 

Together with a proper conmiission. Letters of Credence, and an 
office copy of the same, addressed to the Secretary of Foreign Affaires 
of the United States will be herewith furnished you. 

You will proceed therefore with all convenient despatch to the 
City of Washington on the Potomac, where you will take possession 
of the archives, seals and books belonging to the Texian Legation

892 00BBE8P0KDENCE WITH THB UNITED BTATB& 

of those instructions I hasten by Special Messenger to place you in 
possess of the information contained in that Despatch together with 
the Views and Wishes of the president of the United States. 

Intelligence has reached the President, which has an appearance of 
Authority not to be disregarded that the Mexicans are approaching 
the frontier of Texas in considerable force, that General Paredes, with 
Seyen thousand men is at San Luis Potosi and that General Arista 
with three thousand, principally Cavalry, is in position on or near Rio 
del Norte, and that these troops are destined for the invasion of 
Texas; with, or without a declaration of War with the United States. 

The Government and people of Texas, by their delegates in Con- 
vention having accepted the Conditions of Annexation, proposed 
in the first and second sections of the joint resolutions of the Congress 
of the United States on that Subject, the President, considers it to 
be his constitutional duty to repel a hostile invasion of Texas with all 
the means at his disposal. 

The troops imder General Taylor, have proceeded to the points 
on the frontier of Texas, at which it was supposed they could act 
most efficiently in the attainment of this Object. Orders have also 
been given to Commodore Conner to employ the Naval forces under 
his command in co'operation with the Troops. The regular force 
which could be transferred on this duty, with the reinforcements 
which will immediately be Ordered to report to the Officer Command- 
ing, may not be sufficient to resist so imposing a force, as that, which 
it is believed is about to invade Texad. 

The President has no authority to call out the Militia of Texas, 
but he has entire confidence in the Patriotism and bravery of those 
Gallant men, nor does he doubt their enthusiastic readiness to coop- 
erate with their brethren from the United States, in repelling the in- 
vaders of their Own soil. Their cooperation may become necessary — 
and in View of this Necessity, I am instructed by the president, to

communication with the Government of Texas; and to propose that 
Volunteers may be invited to join the United States' troops, under 
the command of General Taylor; Organized and Officered by Officers 
of their Own Selection, to be mustered into the service of the United 
States in such numbers as the United States' Commanding General 
May deem necessary. I am also instructed to say that the information 
received by the President, is believed to be Authentic, and is such 
that he can not disregard; but the Superior opportunities, enjoyed 
by the Government of Texas and by General Taylor on the frontier, 
may satisfy them that the danger of invasion is not imminent. In 
that event it is not desired that Volunteers should be called from their 
homes into Actual Service ;

Apprehending that there may be a deficiency of Arms and Muni- 
tions in Texas, the President has Ordered them to be placed in a dep6t 
at Galveston Subject to General Taylors Orders, in sufficient quantity 
for ten thousand men, they will be furnished to the Texan Volunteers 
under such regulations as may issue from the War Department for 
their return when the Men are discharged. Rations will be issued 
to the Volunteers while mustered in service of the United States and 
tho there is no appropriation from which the president can have these 
troops paid, there is no reason to doubt, that troops thus employed 
will be placed by Congress upon precisely the same footing, as troops 
would be who had been regularly called Out, to repel an invasion of 
any of the existing States. 

I am likewise instructed to communicate to the Government of 
Texas that it is not the wish or purpose of the President to limit the 
number of men which that Government may deem necessary to 
defend the Country; but to guard against misunderstandings which 
may fatally disturb the harmony of cooperation, it is deemed most 
advisable, that no Volimteers shall be mustered into the Service of 
the United States, except such as may be required and approved by 
the Commander of our troops in that Service. Ail others will act 
under the Authority of Texas. 

In a^ much as imder the peculiar circumstances, there will be felt 
on the part of the United States Government the greatest solicitude 
to know with certainty, what may be the dangers and exigencies 
of Texas, the undersigned would respectfully request Mr Allen to 
commimicate to him for the information of the president of the United 
States by the return of the bearer Mr James Rhodes, what are the 
Views and wishes of his Excellency* the President^of Texas.

inclined to the opinion that she would not adopt tiiat eoone. The 
troops which Ae is moring towards Matamoros I thought probable 
might be intended only for the defence of that point and that the 
collection of them there was induced bj the fact that the U. S were 
moving troops to Corpus Christi and that the intention of the GoTt. 
of Mexico was to act only defensiyely at present. Tliis view however 
may not be correct, and it is certainly best to be fully prepared for 
the oppodte alternative and a due regard to the general welfare may 
make it necessary and quite proper that the itdiole of your force 
should be concentrated at Corpus Christi for the defence of that point. 
In this situation of affairs I concur in your recommendation that the 
different points on our frontier, now occupied by any troops in the 
service of Texas should continue to receive adequate protection in 
the manner you propose, against any outbreak of Indians which 
might occur, as well as against our Mexican enemies. I would there- 
fore designate as you request the following companies to be mistered 
into the service of the U. S. in the manner you propose viz; One full 
company of Gangers (mounted gunmen) under the command of 
Captn P. Hansborough Bell at Corpus CSiristi. One full company, 
of Rangers as above imder the command of Capt. John T. Price 
at or near Goliad this company to be continued in position near 
Ooliad or to be transferred to Corpus CSiristi as you may think 
proper to direct. One full company of Rangers at Bexar under the 
command of Major J. C Hays One full company of Rangers at the 
city of Austin under the command of Ci^t D. C. Cody One full 
company of Artillery at Austin imder the conmiand of an officer to be 
selected and appointed by me One company of Rangers of thirty 
men at Caldwell Milam Co under the command of Lt. R. 8. Teal 
One company of rangers of thirty men at T. J. Smith's in Robertson 
Co. imder the command of Lt. Thomas J. Smith. One company of 
rangers of thirty men at Dallas in Fannin Coimty, under the com- 
mand of Lt. John McGarra. These several companies will it is 
believed afford adequate protection under present circumstances to 
the several points indicated on our frontier, and serve as nuclei 
around which to rally a volunteer or militia force in the event of any 
sudden outbreak of the Indians, or an irruption on the part of the 
Mexicans. 

I send by the bearer of this to Col. Clark L. Owen of Texana a 
Commission as Col. in the volimteer infantry of Texas with instruc- 
tions from the Secty of War and Marine to enroll and have in readi- 
ness a force not exceeding One thousand men — and to mxister them 
into service and place himself under your command and cooperate 
with you in the event of an actual invasion by Mexico, or upon your 
request. The number of men you may wish called into service, 
under Col. Owen not exceeding the above number you will please

man will be expected to furnish himself with a rifle and fifty rounds 
of ammunition, and to confirm strictly to the orders of the officers 
in command.** 

Your proximity to the scene of active operations and means of 
early information will enable you to judge correctly of the amoimt of 
force you wOl require, If those designated above should not be 
sufficient I will at your request call into service any additional number 
of men, within my control that you may indicate. 

I shall remain at this place imtill a day or two after the adjourn- 
ment of the Convention which will probably take place about the 1st

manently here. If in his power he will pay you a visit in the course 
of two or three weeks at Corpus Christi. I shall return to this place

relation to the dispositions proper to be made for the permanent

by E A Rhodes, Esqr., acting Consul of the United States at Gal- 
veston, under date of the 21st instant communicating intelligence 
transmitted to the President of the United States, touching the 
recent movements of Mexican Troops under Grenerals Paredas** and 
Arista, and the preparatory measures of His Excellency adopted and 
advised for the protection of Texas against their attacks. 

Intelligence of a similar character, but less full in its details, has 
been conmiunicated to the Executive in a dispatch from Gren Taylor, 
under date of the 16 instant, and in a note from Mr Donelson, dated 
the 5th instant and transmitted to this Department. His Excel- 
lency's reply to the note of Gen Taylor was dispatched on the 23d 
instant and its contents express the opinion then entertained by the 
Executive that the Mexican forces concentrating at Matamoras and 
other points upon the Rio Grande, were* not intended for the imme- 
diate invasion of Texas, but rather to remain in position and act 
defensively for the present. That opinion was based upon such evi- 
dences as were then in possession of the Executive; but the addi- 
tional and specific information contained in the .note of Mr. Rhodes, 
relating to the intelligence from authentic sources which has reached 
the President of the United States, leaves little room to doubt that 
those troops are designed by the Mexican Government for hostile 
operations against Texas. There is no reason to suppose that such 
hostiUties would be preceeded by any formal declaration of war by 
Mexico against the United States; nor that her belligerent operations 
would be carried on [in] the form of sustained and systematic war- 
fare. After a brief series of sudden attacks and rapid evolutions, 
the Mexican forces would again retire across the Rio Grande, with 
what of success or defeat might befall them. Since the battle of 
San Jacinto, they have never entertained a serious hope of recon- 
quering the country, nor a settled determination to invade it. As 
heretofore, they would now be content after inflicting upon the 
border the calamities incident to an irregular and destructive irrup- 
tion of their semi-barbarous soldiery. 

The President has at the request of Gen Taylor designated four 
full companies of sixty men each, and three half companies of Rangers, 
and one company of ArtiUery, all properly officered to be mustered 
into the service of the United States. He has also ordered Col Clark 
L Owen of Texana to enrol and have in readiness a volunteer corps 
of infantry — not to exceed one thousand men. These forces will be 
ready to act with the utmost promptitude against the enemy for the 
defence of the frontier and at the call of Gen Taylor. His Excel- 
lency further informed that officer in his reply that he would at his

request call into service any additional number of men which might 
be required, and which could be furnished. 

Gren Taylor will doubtless communicate to the Executive any 
cause or occasion which may arise for an additional employment of 
forces to cooperate with those under his command; and his call will 
be promptly attended to. From his frontier position and the facilities 
in his power for acquiring all necessary information, he will no doubt 
be able to anticipate any important hostile movement of the enemy 
in season for a sufficient force to concentrate and to meet it. 

The President is gratified to learn from the note of Mr. Rhodes that 
arms and munitions of war are placed in depot at Galveston suf- 
ficient for ten thousand men by order of the Executive of the United 
States. In the event of an invasion by the Mexicans, those arms and 
munitions would be indispensable for the use of the Texian soldiery; 
and in that event, it is the design of His Excellency, that the seat of 
active hostilities shall be as soon as practicable forced back beyond 
the Gio Grande, and that the scene of war be transferred to the 
enemy's country. 

The undersigned has the honor to present to Mr Bhodes the assur- 
ance of his distinguished regard, and to be.

WAaHiifGTON [City] 8 Sepiemier I84S. 
DuAR Sib 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, on Sunday Evening 
31 St. ultimo, of your communication of 2nd idem, informing me, of 
the iUness of the Hon. David S. Kaufman, and the probable delay 
of his arrival here in consequence; and covering a commission, 
authorizing me to perform the functions of Acting Charg6 d' Affaires 
until his arrival, and to open the letter of Instructions addressed to 
him for my further guidance. 

In obedience to these instructions, I addressed a note to the Sec- 
retary of State of the United States, on the 1st Inst, informing him 
of my appointment, and requesting him to appoint a time, at which 
I might call on him and present my letter of credit [sic], 

I received no official reply to my note imtil today, when I received 
the communication from the Secretary of State of 6th. Inst, copy of 
which you will find herewith, and to which please be referred, inform- 
ing me that the President of the United States, for reasons therein 
assigned, deemed it improper to receive a Charg6 d'Affaires from 
Texas, but desired that I should remain here as Agent of Texas. 
Copy of my reply, I transmit herewith. 

Having neither Instructions nor precedent for my guidance, I can 
only refer the matter, through you, to his Excellency the President 
of Texas, and await here his further instructions. In the mean- 
time, however, as this dedsion of the President, proceeds from no 
unkind feeling, but from the intimacy of the relations of the two 
Governments, forbidding, in his opinion, that Texas should any 
longer be treated as a Stranger, altho', I cannot communicate officially 
with the Government of the United States, I shall continue, indi- 
vidually, to cultivate the kind feelings at present existing on the 
part of this Government towards the Government of Texas, and 
imofficially, to bring to the notice of the President, all matters, 
which it would have been my provipice to do, if I had been received 
officially. This, the President of the U. S. has desired to do, and 
has promised to give my communications all the consideration they 
would have had if official. 

The President of the United States, requests me to tender to the 
President of Texas, the assurances of his sincere regard and his regret 
that he has not been able to comply with his wishes in r^ard to my 
reception. The President has expressed to me his full assiu*ance of 
the cheerful and zealous co-operation of the President of Texas in car-

(Copy.) 

Washington [Cnr] 6th. September I84S. 
Deab Sib 

I have had the honor to receive your note of the first instant, 
informing me that the President of Texas had appointed you Acting 
Charg6 d' Affaires of that Government near the Government of the 
United States, and requesting me to appoint a time when you may 
call for the purpose of presenting your credentials. 

Your note has been submitted to the President who, after a careful 
examination of the subject, has directed me to inform you, that, in 
his opinion, the State of Texas has now become so intimately iden- 
tified with the other States of the Union, that it would not be proper 
to receive a Chaig6 d'AjOtaires from its Government and thus treat 
it as a foreign nation. 

The moment that the Convention of Texas had ratified the terms 
of annexation proposed by the Congress of the United States the 
substantial engagements of both parties were complete and nothing 
then remained to be done but her more formal admission into the 
Union in compliance with these engagements. The President has, 
accordingly, directed the troops of the United States to march into 
her territoiy and has determined to defend it against the forces of 
Mexico. Under these circumstances, Texas has already, in his 
judgment, become in fact, if not in form, one of our States, at least 
so far as to render it obligatory on him to protect her against foreign 
invasion. It would, therefore, it appears to him, be incompatible 
with these relations to receive a pubUc minister from her government 
as though she were still a stranger. 

It is certain, however, that the Government of Texas yet retains 
all the powers that it formerly possessed except such as would be 
inconsistent with the engagements of the respective parties to con- 
summate annexation. It is still both the right and duty of that 
Government to repel a Mexican invasion, and should such an event

occur, it would be extremely convenient, if not absolutely necessary, 
to have an agent of Texas in the City of Washington. Other cir- 
cumstances might be adverted to which would render this highly 
proper. Whilst, therefore, the President cannot receive you in a 
diplomatic character, he will be much gratilSed should you determine 
to remain in this City as an agent of Texas. In that capacity you 
may render essential service to both Countries. 

In arriving at these conclusions, the President requests me to 
assure you of his sincere regard for the President of Texas and his 
regret that he has not been able to comply with his wishes in r^ard 
to your reception. 
With sentiments of Respect I Remain

Legation of Texas 
Washington City Septr SO, 1845 
Hon Ebenezeb Allen 

Secretary of State 
Deab Sm, 

I arrived in this city on the 19th inst and found myself in a singular 
position in regard to my reception on account of the course pursued 
by the United States Government towards Mr W. D. Lee and pro- 
mulgated by the Union. Mr Buchanan Secretary of State had 
addressed Mr Lee a communication (a copy of which has been trans- 
mitted to the Department) declining for reasons therein specified to 
accredit him. 

On the same day that I arrived at this city Major A. J. Donelson 
also arrived. He expressed regret at the stand the Govt had assumed, 
in regard to this question. On the 22d I called on Major D. who was 
then unwell at the Presidents Mansion and while there he sent for the 
President who received me with marked attention and took me into 
the Executive office and introduced me to Messrs Marcy, Mason and 
Johnson of the Cabinet. The conversation ranged over every topic 
connected with Texas with the exception of the relations that my 
Government bore to the United States. On that subject there was 
perfect silence. I immediately then determined on the course that 
I would pursue and the next morning I sent the Department of State 
the communication a copy of which is herewith enclosed and trans- 
mitted. Although in this communication I declined to ask a recon- 
sideration of the question and declared that in regard to that matter 
I should wait for instructions from home, yet I felt it due to my Gov- 
ernment at once in respectful and friendly terms to vindicate it from 
an imputation of ignorance of its present Relations to the United States. 

I sincerely trust that my commimication will prove satisfactory 
to His Excellency the President of Texas and the Department. 
Although it has not yet been answered officially and will not prob- 
ably be answered until the Department transmits me further instruc- 
tions, to be communicated to this Government, yet I know it has

been received here in the kindest manner. Mr Lee and myself have 
dined with the President, and Secretary Walker where we met with 
members of the Cabinet, all of whom evinced the kindest feelings 
towards the Government and People of Texas. 

Since my communication above referred to I have received the 
new Constitution for "the State of Texas" which most conclusively 
sustains every position that I then took. If it had been here before 
the President and Cabinet took their stand I know a very different 
course would have been pursued. With my communication unan- 
swered the whole question will r^nain in Statu quo imtil I can hear 
from my Government again. 

Through your kind permission, on tomorrow I leave here on a short 
visit to New York City and my Relatives in Pennsylvania. I will 
be back again however by the time your response to Mr Lees coipunu- 
nication arrives. While individually I should have no objection in 
returning home inmiediately it is my duty and shall be my pleasure 
to obey faithfully the instructions of my Government.

Legation of Texas 
Washington [City] 28 Sept 1845. 

The undersigned has the honor to inform the Hon. Mr. Buchanan 
Secry. of State of the U. S. that he has been appointed by his Excel- 
lency the President of Texas, Chargfi d' Affaires of the Govt, of Texas 
near the Govt, of the United States and, but for the tenor of Mr. P.'s 
note of 6th. Inst, addressed to my immediate predecessor Hon. W. D. 
Lee, the undersigned would ask for the appointment of a time when 
he might have the honor of presenting his letter of credence 

In your communication of the date above alluded to, you state 
that it is the opinion of the President that ^^fhe State of Texas has 
now become so intimately identified with the other States of the 
Union that it would not be proper to receive a Chaig6 from its 
Gk)vt. and thus treat it as a foreign Nation." 

After the expression of an opinion thus decided on the part of his 
Excellency it might be considered indelicate in the undecsigned to 
urge a reconsideration of the question and it would place his Govt, 
in a position that he would not have it occupy. He wiU uot do so 
of his own responsibility. On this subject he wiU await the instruc- 
tions of his Govt. 

The decision thus made in regard to the reception of my immediate 
predecessor however seems to place the Govt. wh. I have the honor 
to represent in so singular an attitude before the world, The attitude

of ignorance of its present relation mitk the United States, that I feel 
it due to it, as well as to myself to vindicate it from that charge. 
The kind, friendly, and confidential relations which exist between 
the two governments, to be blended shortly in ''a more perfect 
Union", will I trust authorize me to do so with a frankness and 
freedom that I might not otherwise indulge in, at the same time 
assuring the Hon. Mr. B. that whatever may be the course his Govt, 
may finally pursue in regard to this matter, as far as Texas is con- 
cerned it can throw no impediment in the way of the final consiun- 
mation of the great American Question of annexation. By the pro- 
visions of '^a joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United 
States'' the 1st. and 2nd. sections of which were selected and pre- 
sented to the consideration of the Govt, of Texas, certain duties 
were required to be performed by the '^Existing Govt." of Texas 
by ''Deputies in convention assembled" and by ''the People" them- 
selves in their original Sovereign Capacity. The Existing Govt, of 
Texas was to give its consent to the proposed diange, The Deputies 
in Convention were to form a Constitution of a Republican CSxaracter 
and the people themselves were to approve said constitution and the 
constitution together with the evidence of their approval of the same 
was to be sent to the President of the United S. on or before the Ist. 
day of Jany. 1846 to be by him laid before your Congress for its 
final action. All these conditions have to be complied with on the 
part of the Govet. the Con/oention and the People of Texas before it 
can be said with propriety that Texas has "ratified the terms of 
Annexation proposed by the Congress of the U S." 

Now how many of these "powers of the State" have performed the 
duties required of them preliminary to sl further action on the part 
of the U. S. Congress? But one of the Three. The existing Govt, 
has given its consent, but, as far as we are informed, the Convention 
has not yet adopted a State constitution and certain it is that the 
People in whom and whom alone, not only by the theory of all popular 
Govts, but by an express provision of our constitution, is vested 
the right to abolish our form of Govt, and erect another in its stead, 
have not yet ratified that constitution. "All poUtical power is inhe- 
rent in the People and they have at all times the inalienable right 
to alter their Govt, in such manner as they may think proper" 
Dec. of rights Constitution of Tex 

It may be argued that the People have in this instance effected 
the change through their representatives or Deputies in convention 
assembled, but this ai^gument is untenable, as the joint resolution 
above referred to plainly draws a distinction between the "Deputies 
in Convention" assembled "and the People of said RepubUc of 
Texas." If the universal practice of submitting amendments of the 
constitutions of States of the American Union to the People for their

404 AMEBIOAK HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ratification or rejection be right or expedient, how much more so 
is it when not only the whole constitution of Texas is proposed to be 
changed but her nationality itself merged in that of another 

But the joint resolution on this point is explicit, and it is the 
''Law of Union" for both Governments. 

It is true as remarked by Mr. B. that ''the Convention had (has) 
ratified the terms of annexation proposed by the Congress of the 
U. S.''. Composed as that honorable body is of so much of the 
talent, integrity and patriotism of the Land they have done and will 
do every thing in their power to consummate so desirable an object. 
They have "ordained and declared that they assent to and accept 
the proposals contained in the 1st. and 2nd. sections'' of the joint 
resolution above referred to. Now so far as the first and 2nd. sec- 
tions are concerned the ordinance of the Convention was unneces- 
sary and supererogatory — It travelled out of the Record altho' it did 
much good in quieting the pubUc mind by the extraordinary and 
gratifying unanimity evinced in favor of this interesting measure. 
A simple reading of said sections will however satisfy every mind 
that this was not a duty prescribed by them. The formation of a 
State constitution is all that they require. This view of the ques- 
tion I have no doubt has been or will be sustained by the Conven- 
tion itself for I see in the papers that a committee of that body has 
recommended that the question not only of the adoption of the con- 
stitution but also of annexation be referred to the People themselves 
at the Ballot Box, a recommendation which I have no doubt has 
already been concurred in. More or less could not have been expected 
from such a body. 

It cannot be said that the People by electing deputies favorable 
to annexation deprived or meant to deprive themselves of a final 
decision of this question at the Polls. They had not the power to 
do so by the said joint resolution, nor had they the inclination. This 
same People have on the 1st. of this month elected members for the 
tenth Congress of the RepubHc of Texas a proceeding which would 
have been superfluous not to say treasonable if they had not reserved 
to themselves the right of finally deciding the question of a change 
of Grovt. Altho' the 1st. and 2nd. Sections do not litterally provide 
for the submission of the question of annexation to the People, yet a 
decision of that question is substantially involved in the vote upon 
the adoption of the constitution. Let us suppose for instance that 
the people should not adopt the constitution submitted to them or 
if adopted that the same should not be transmitted to the President 
of the United States on or before 1st. of Jany 1846. Would the 
terms of our admission be complied with notwithstanding the said 
Ordinance of the Convention? Clearly not. Indeed the said joint

resolution provides that these proceedmgs shall be had by the Oovt. 
the Convention and the People before the Ist. day of January 1846, 
''in order that the same (Texas) may he admitted as one of the States 
of the Union" 

It recognizes no immediate no Urntorial State — ^The moment Texas 
looses her seperate sovereignty she assumes the rank of a sovereign 
State of the American Confederacy 

Your Government requires of Texas no pupilage, no probation. 
Her sovereignty is never lost, it will only flow in a different channel. 

Texas is as yet an independent RepubKc. Her Govt, has given 
her consent to annexation and the Convention are in the process of 
performing the duties required of them. During these proceedings 
past present avd to come, Texas maintains her independent and sep- 
erate attitude and wiU corUinue to do so imtil the final consimunation 
of the measiu^ of annexation. Her President continues to discharge 
his duties. Her courts are now in session by virtue of authority 
from the Republic of Texas and a Congress was elected at the usual 
annual elections. Her revenue from imposts as well as direct taxes 
are still collected as usual, and her gallant army small tho it be con- 
tinues ready to defend the country from aggression. 

It is true that the U. S. has sent a portion of its army into that 
country but it was by invitation of the representatives of the owners 
of the soil, the people of Texas. The invitation of the Convention was 
given three days after the ordinance accepting the terms etc showing 
conclusively that the Convention did not conceive that the acceptance 
by it of the terms of annexation ipso facto brought Texas into the 
Union. Their presence in no manner impairs the separate sov- 
ereignty of Texas, They were there at Nacogdoches in 1836 under 
Genl. Gaines and yet in that case the sovereignty of Texas was not 
questioned. In that case as in the present they were there by the 
consent of the people and for purposes of self defence. The people 
of the United States have the right to form a compact of imion with 
Texas If they have a right to form a compact of any character 
with her as an independent power they have the right to form a 
constitutional compact 

If England and France had a right to form compacts with her so 
has the United States and no one has a right to question that power 
And if they have the right to form this- constitutional compact they 
have a clear right to combine their strength (as is now done) to pre- 
vent their rights from being impaired. Indeed when the Treaty 
form of annexation was attempted the Government of the U. S. 
obligated itself to protect Texas from invasion pending the negociation. 
And now the U. S. are ready to protect Texas from invasion during 
the proceedings necessary to consummate the measure on her part

in order to enable her to complete the work without molestation. 
This is the theory. The Nine years exemption of Texas from invasion 
satisfies the imdersigned that it will never be called into prdctice. 

The midersigned sincerely trusts that the foregoing remarks will 
be received by the Hon. Secry. of State in the spirit with which they 
are written and knows that the utmost harmony and friendship will 
continue to exist between the two govts, imtil the now "Lone Star" 
becomes "One of the ma/ny " that ghtter in the American constellation. 

The imdersigned would in conclusion take occasion to remark that 
the promptitude energy and patriotism with which his Excellency 
the President of the U. S. has acted in forwarding the measure of 
annexation have earned for him the admiration and gratitude of the 
Government and people of Texas.

Washington [City] 8 October ISJfi. 
My Deab Sir 

Since I last wrote you which was I beUeve a few days before Col. 
Kaufman arrived here, I still continue without a word from you, or 
any thing from your dept to this Legation. Col. K. addressed a 
communication to Mr. Buchanan soon after his arrival, copy of which 
he sent to your Department. No reply has been made to it. The 
argument is unanswerable, but the determination of this Government 
to adhere to their decision is not to be changed. Their course in 
relation to Col. K. and myself was dictated by policy which they 
judged good, and which I was convinced from the first would not be 
changed. I wrote you to that effect and also to President Jones. I 
presume not many days will elapse before your further instructions 
will arrive and we shall then know what to do. Col. Kaufman left 
here a week ago for New Yorjf and on his return will visit his friends 
in Pennsylvania and return here in about a fortnight. 

He intends to run for the U. S. Congress and will not be desirous of 
remaining here much longer.

You will see a communication in the Union of this evening most of 
which is pirated from a document which you will readily recognize.

The fact is the document alluded to was very much admired and its 
effect vAitsf^ it was intended to produce one was admirable, but as 
the exhibition Wias limited to His Excellency and the Hon. J. B.<* I 
avttiled [myself] of an oversight in the publication of some New 
Hampdiire ilgsolutions in the Union to insist on the insertion of this 
communication which draws lai^ely from a source which I was glad 
to have at command in framing the article. There is great difficulty 
in getting any thing in to the Union which is intended for the benefit 
of any individual except the President and his Secretary of the 
Treasury 

It is generally thought that Mr. Buchanan will go on the Bench 
and the present Atty. Grenl. will take the State Department. 

Duff Greene is busy as usual but without influence direct altho' it 
is said he has some indirect. Mr. Walker is unquestionably looking 
to the succession but I think by travelling too fast may trip. The 
immeiiale object of all the mcuieuvers here now is to secure the print- 
ing df the Union— and for ffiis, the maUcious say, many heads are 
sarved* for the time being, from the guillotine^ only to fall at the call of 
some mettlfcer of Congress who has a vote foi; printer, and a friend who 
wanter a place. Blair & Rives are building Jackson Hall 50 feet on 
Pennsylvania Avenue by 100 feet deep and immediately in ihe rear 
they have a modest brick edifice 50 feet by 80, in which is a Steam 
En^ne anid printing establishment. They refused to sell the name 
of the GFlohe to Ritchie & Heiss and it is believed by most people that 
the Resurection of that paper is intended. Fisk and Dow of the 
U. S. Journal Radical say that but for them this adipinistration would 
have been a Conservative one. They also want the printing. 

Some of the Senators and Representatives are beginning to arrive. 
Neither Col. K. nor myself have ever permitted an opportunity to 
escape for vindicating President Jones and his Cabinet in his course 
on the annexation measure. I believe President Polk and his Cabinet 
are satisfied and take a proper view of the matter. I think the com- 
munication which will be in the Union this Evening will have a good 
effect and if I find the comments here favorable I shall have it inserted 
in other papers and circulated extensively. Col. K. left town so soon 
that altho' we talked the matter over I had no opportunity of sub- 
mitting the article to him before sending it in. 

The Te!{tas papers arrive here very irregularly and I am oftener 
indebted to New Of leans papers than any other source for information 
about Texas: Frequent ajid fuU communications even upon matters 
comparatively uniitiportant would often be useful here. There is an 
army of letter writers here for newspapers over the whole country 
during the Session of Congress and quite a regiment here now, and 
the commutiication of small items of information or gossip insures 

a Fiesldeiit Polk and Secretaiy Bnohanan.

their good will and disposes them to render small services in return. 
Should Col. Ejkufman return home and the President wish me to 
remain here until Congress acts upon our State Constitution and bring 
home the result of that action, I should like very much to do so, pro- 
vided it is considered proper imder all the drcumstances to apply a 
portion of the appropriation to my benefit. 

This would I fear be necessary as I have no arrangement sure by 
which I could defray my own expenses till then. This is not a con- 
sideration of avarice but of necessity and I would not have mentioned 
it except for the latter. 

I think that the necessity for some agent of the Republic of Texas 
here is clear, and it is certain that a DiphmaRe Agent will only be 
unofficially received and acknowledged in fact hul not in form. If 
Kaufmans letter is published .as it may probably be by a call from 
Congress the result will be more injurious to the Cabinet here than 
their receiving him formally and properly would have been. It shows 
that the reasons which are set forth in Mr. Buchanans official letter 
to me are 7U> reasons at aU, and the other reasons can-not be assigned 
publicly. Neither Col. Kaufman nor myself have prompted any 
remarks which have appeared in any of the papers on this subject, but 
both of us while we have on all proper occasions maintained the posi- 
tion of Independent Republicans and of the Republic of Texas, we 
have at the same time cultivated the good feelings of President Polk 
and his friends and Cabinet, and have unofficially been treated with 
marked kindness and courtesy. 

To day I received a note from Gov. Marcy requesting me to call at 
the War Department to consult on a matter relating to Texas. I 
called and he showed me a letter from Mr. Pierce M. Butler informing 
him that he was about starting for the Indian Country under a Com- 
mission from President Polk to make Treaties etc. with the Co- 
manches etc. on the Frontier of Texas and advised Gov. Marcy to 
communicate the fact to the Texian Govt. 

I told him that the Texian Govt, had Indian Agents through whom 
they communicated with the Indians in Texas and suggested that if 
the U. S. desired to make treaties with Indians in Texas it would be 
proper to communicate their desire to the Texian Govt, and I was 
sure the President of Texas would co-operate etc. Here was another 
way of recognizing our Independence, and it was no go. But the Gov. 
said he would address a copy of the letter to Mister Kaufman the 
agent of Texas and he could use his own discretion what to do with it. 

So I suppose our Indian relations are taken off the hands of our 
Govt. — and like the Shape of the Revenue provisions and Diplomatic 
relations made to fit the position assumed by this Govt. 

The promised Copy has not yet been sent it, and as this is the last 
day that letters from here will be in time for the first trip of the New 
York, I will send this off any how. The Union does not come out imtil

self and the Hon Mr Buchanan on the subject of the reception and 
recognition by the President of the United States of a Chargfi

The President having examined these despatches, I am directed

consequence of the premises, you will at your earliest convenience 
return to this coimtry. 

In as much as a reception as the diplomatic agent of this Govern-

his residence near the Government to which he is accredited, are to 
be omitted by you on quitting the City of Washington.

Legation of Texas 
WasUngton [City] Sd. Nov 1845. 
Deab Sm 

No communication has been received at this Legation from your 
Department since my arrival (Septr. 19th.) and consequently no reply 
to Mr. Lees communication of the 8th. September and mine of 30th. 
idem. I am without advice and instructions as to the course the 
Department would have me pursue. Of one thing however I am 
persuaded, and that is that the Government here will not under any 
circumstances change its position in regard to the relations that Texas 
bears to it. 

Consistency, pride of opinion, interest, and perhaps in some degree 
the triumphant consummation of annexation itself, demand a steady 
adherence to the course originally taken and promulgated by the 
official organ. 

Under these circumstances, I feel persuaded that the Department 
would not request me to ask a reconsideration of the question of my 
reception, to be followed, as it would be, by a second rejection. To 
remain here as agent etc or in any other capacity than that in which 
I have been sent, I would not be willing, even admitting that our 
laws recognized such an officer. Under all the circumstances there- 
fore I have determined to leave for Texas and to day I leave this City 
via Baltimore and Wheeling for the South 

Mr. Lee will however remain and faithfully carry out any instruc- 
tions he may receive from the Department and I am highly gratified

of one whose fideUty abiUty and tact emminently entitle him to your 
your favorable consideration. 

The most kind and friendly unofficial intercourse has been kept up 
between the President, Secretary of State and members of the Cabi-

suggestions have been treated with great attention and respect. 

I sincerely trust that the course I have determined to pursue will 
be entirely acceptable to his Excellency President Jones and to the 
Department over which you have the honor to preside. Certain it 
is it has been determined on out of the highest regard and respect for 
the Government that honored me with its confidence, and did I not 
feel morally certain that the course I am now pursuing is the one 
that would be reccommended and will be fully approved at home, I 
should wait here imtil I heard from your Department. 

It would afford me much pleasure to secure the approbation of his

I have the satisfaction to inform you that both the President of 
the U. S. and the Secretary of State have assured me that the atten- 
tion of Congress will be called to the claims of Texas for indemnity 
in the Snively and Red River Custom House Cases and the Secretary 
of State further promised me that he would request his friend Mr. 
Allen of Ohio to introduce and read a Bill in his place in Congress at 
as early a day as practicable after the meeting of Congress to provide 
for the payment of these claims. 

I have been urging this matter upon the attention of this Govern- 
ment. They needed reminding of it for when I first spoke to Mr. 
Buchanan on the subject, he told me that he had never heard of it 
as Secretary of State altho' he had some slight reccoUection of it as a 
member of Congress. 

So soon as he had time to look into the records of his Department 
relating to the claims, however, he with earnestness assured me that 
it should be attended to. And altho' as an invariable rule he declined 
to state in a written communication any thing which will appear in 
the Presidents message he told me he had prepared a paragraph which 
will be inserted in the message reccommending an immediate appro- 
priation to pay these claims. 

I have not had the pleasure to be assured that any of my private 
letters to yourself or his Excellency the President have been received, 
nor have I any intimation from your Department whether my desire 
to secure the approbation of his Excellency has been successful. 
Should I be so fortunate, as I sincerely hope I may be, an intimation

Sir, 

By the Joint Resolution of the Senate and House of Representa- 
tives of the "Cnited States ''For annexing Texas to the United States", 
approved the 1st March 1845, among the conditions on which the 
consent of Congress is given to the annexation, it is provided in the 
2d section of said Resolutions that *'said State, when admitted into 
the Union, after ceding to the United States, all public edifices, forti- 
fications, barracks, ports and harbors, navy and navy yards, docks, 
magazines, arms, armaments, and all other property and means per- 
taining to the public defence, belonging to said RepubHc of Texas, 
shall retain all the pubUc funds etc etc": And by the constitution of 
the State of Texas, adopted in convention, on the 27th August 1845, 
it is provided, in the 8th Section of Article 13, that **The Legislature 
shall also adopt such measures as may be required to cede to the 
United States, at the proper time, all public edifices, fortifications, 
barracks, ports, harbors navy and navy yards, docks, magazines, arms 
and armaments, and all other property and means pertaining to the 
pubUc defence, now belonging to the Republic of Texas." 

Under these provisions, you are authorised and directed, as Agent 
of the Government of the United States, to receive into your custody 
from the person authorised on the part of the State of Texas, to 
deliver the same, all the public property above enumerated. If no

Burnet to Santa Anna. 

Velasco. 17 May 1836 
Excellent Sir. 

I have the honor to recieve Your Excellency's communication of 
this day apprising me of the return of General WoU, and of the cir- 
cumstances that conduced to it.** 

The government of Texas actuated by the principles of an enlight- 
ened humanity, and by a sincere desire to observe all the approved 
usages of the most civilized nations, cannot but regret that an event 
so painful as the one mentioned in Your Excellency's communica- 
tion should have occured. The conduct that has been manifested 
towards the prisoners whom the casualties of war have thrown into 
their power, affords indubitable testimony that no intention could 
exist on their part, to infringe, in the slightest degree, the equitable 
** rights of nations,'* in the person of General WoU. 

I trust Your Excellency will readily percieve from the tenor of the 
letter of General Rusk to Genl WoU of 12 Inst., a copy of which 
accompanies Your Excellency's communication, that the reason of 

a April 28, 1836. See Calendar.

COERESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 419 

Genl Woll's recall to Camp was predicated in the apprehension that 
the excitement produced by the cruelties inflicted on our countrymen 
who had fallen into the power of Mexicans together with some aUeged 
manifestations of passion on the part of Genl WoU himself, might 
lead to some act of violence relative to his person, by intemperate 
and irrational persons, who are to be found in all armies and especially 
in those composed in part of volunteers. 

In making these just concessions to Your Excellency, I cannot but 
remark, that no portion of them is extracted by the intemperate and 
uncourteous threats found in the letter of Genl Woll to Genl Rusk, 
which You transmit to me. The terms of that letter convey more 
evidence of petulance on the part of the writer, than cause of appre- 
hension to this government from his projected appeal to the world. 
The government of Texas can feel no hesitation in submitting their 
conduct, during the present contest, to the scrutiny of an enUghtened 
age, and more especially when that conduct will be opposed in con- 
spicuous contrast, to the many aberrations from the rules of civiUzed 
warfare, that have characterized the deportment of their enemies. 

This government has never regarded General Woll as a prisoner of 
war. The detention of which he complains resulted from a deep 
sense of the Sanctity of his position and a careful anxiety to preserve 
[it] inviolate. 

In conclusion I would say to Your Excellency that so soon as it 
may be practicable General Woll shall be safely conducted to the 
Head Quarters of the Mexican Army — but should the General's great 
impatience decline all prudential consideration, he is at Uberty to 
depart at any moment with such means of protection as are at present 
at our command. 

With high considerations

Santa Anna to Bubnet.* 
Excellent Sir, 

When the cabmet of Texas has ratified with me a solemn treaty 
which I have compUed with on my part as far as my situation allows, 
When protests have been made by your Excellency, that you would 
perish with all your family rather than fail in what has been promised 
me; — and when General Filisola has repUed that on his part the whole 
treaty shall be religiously fulfilled, having previously obeyed what- 
ever orders I have communicated to him; — then your Excellency, 
hearing the clamors of certain individuals just arrived from New 
Orleans, issues a decree to the commander of this vessel, that he 
should set me on shore in order to continue the close confinement in 
which I have so long languished — I cannot conceal from your Excel- 
lency the siuT)rise which such conduct has produced when the mem- 
bers of the Cabinet inspired me with so much confidence, and as I 
cannot but beUeve that my personal enemies have triumphed and 
are going to enjoy the barbarous pleasure of executing their ven- 
geance. I beseech your Excellency at least, that I may be shot on 
board this vessel, because there are soldiers here who can execute it, 
and I cannot leave it aUve. I hope your Excellency will be pleased 
to answer me, and recive my highest consideration. God and

has directed me to open a correspondence through you, for the 
purpose of arranging for the mutual release of all the prisoners of

object can be effected on the following terms. 

1. All the Texian prisoners of war at Matamoros or else where in 
the possession of the Mexican Govt., shall be delivered at Brazos 
Santiago to an agent of this Govt, who will be appointed for that 
purpose. 

2. The same number of Mexican prisoners according to rank, shall 
be set at liberty, in exchange for said Texian prisoners, and delivered 
to an agent of the Mexican Govt, at Galveston. 

3. All the other Mexican prisoners of war in the possession of this 
Govt, shall be liberated on their parole of honor, not to serve against 
Texas, nor in the Mexican army at any point or place whatever dur- 
ing the war, unless they are first regularly exchanged.

difficulties overcome us. We reached Washington (N^;roville)

The draft shall send up to St Louis Potosi the first mail day. The 
news of St Anna's release is far from being pleasing intelligence to 
Mexico and there is not any convention with the Government of U S. 
that he may enter into on his part that will be fulfilled. Bustamente 
his mortal enemy has arrived from Europe and is in Mexico. Here 
we have about 1200 men in good condition, destined no where now, 
I should suppose. The Genl in command is St Anna greatest enemy 
and here he would be received at the cannons mouth. Bravo is still 
at Monte Rea. where he is now Ukely to remain. St Anna's release 
will probably put the whole country in a bloody revolution, and as 
things stand now there is nothing At present to fear to the parties 
that somewhat interest you I do not think it Ukely that I shall be 
here very long, so that there is no occasion to write. The Mexican 
Navy seems to be laying up in ordinary at Vera Cruz. Business 
pretty fair and 700,000 expected in five or six days, from 2 to 300,000 
of which will come by the Schr Cora, and Danl H Miller from what I 
can learn I think in the end everything will turn out better than 
you expect, however, I will be better able to inform the prospect a 
little later.

Dear Sir. 

Things are about in the same state as they were when I last wrote 
you. The country is very quiet, and I hear no talk of any miUtary 
movement whatsoever Yesterday, the new constitution was pro- 
claimed in all the pubUc places — which was listened to scarcely by 
any one and by those few with complete apathy. We have here 
near 2000 men in good condition. They are fully paid up to the 1st 
Feby. but what they are here for no one knows. As to going against 
Texas — ^was such an order to be issued I beUeve they would resist to 
a mjan Tis a service very unpopular, and tis generally considered by 
the most enlightened Mexicans as a country lost to them for ever — 
therefore there is little to be feared for the future. The appearance 
of St Anna whenever he does come will be the signal of a terrible out- 
breaking, and they will require all the force they can command to 
fight against each other without sending troops out of the Country. 

a This letter is inserted here as representing information of a kind that the Texan government was gather- 
ing in various ways, especially through its agents, like Toby, and by which it was more or less guided in its 
action. It was, of course, transmitted by Toby, whose house— T. Toby;& Bro.— were Texan agents In New

few days judging from what has already taken place. Our putting

remainder of said Garrison to leave the place, the same with Camargo,

they have resolved (according to certain information I have received 
from the Interior) to be sacrifised rather than any longer to suffer 
under a Military despotism. The cause of Uberty must infalibly 
triumph and those towns and yours will again very shortly be united 
in bonds of former amity. Upon this flattering prospect, I can with

Webb to Bee. 

Department of State 

Houston 20th Fehy 18S9. 
Hon. Barnard E. Bee 
Sir 

The President, anxious to effect a settlement of the existing dif- 
ferences with Mexico, and to restore peace and harmony, has appointed 
you Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Texas, near the (jov- 
emment of that Country. I have therefore the honor to hand you 
your Commission and Credentials as such, and to express to you 
his wish that you will proceed with as little delay as possible, by 
the most convenient rout to Vera Cruz, or such other point as you 
may deem best, for making known to that Government the object 
of your mission. 

As this is the first attempt on the part of Texas to establish dip- 
lomatic relations with Mexico, it will be necessary to approach the 
subject with great caution and circumspection. I would suggest the 
propriety of your stopping in the first instance at Vera Cruz, Tam- 
pico, or such other point as you may select, and forwarding thence 
to the Government, a concise statement of the objects of your Mis- 
sion, and respectfully ask to be received for the purpose of exhib- 
iting your Authority and making known more fully the wishes of 
the President. This however, is a mere suggestion, and not intended 
to control you in the course to be pursued, should circumstances 
in your judgment offer a better one. 

It is hardly to be expected that you will be formally received as 
Minister Plenipotentiary of this RepubUc, until a treaty of peace 
has been made, and the Independence of the Country acknowledged. 
Indeed, such a reception would be in itself an aclmowledgment of 
our legitimate existence as a nation and a virtual recognition of our 
Independence; and as that is more than we can look, or even hope 
for, untill attained by negotiation, you will, in the event of a refusal 
to receive you as Minister, make your propositions as the agent of 
this Government; and to enable you to do so, seperate credentials 
for this purpose are furnished you. 

Indeed, it may be better, not to make known your higher functions, 
untill you have sounded your way as agent, and ascertained whether 
or not, they will be disposed to treat with you in either capacity; 
but in this, as in all other matters preliminary to entering upon your 
negotians you will be guided by your own judgment and discretion. 

Your powers as agent are plenary, and under them you are fully 
authorized to negotiate for peace, an^ to form and sign a treaty 
securing it, but in making such treaty, you will require the uncon- 
dUional recognition of the Independence of Texas, and will admit

no limits less than those prescribed by the Act of Congress entitled 
**an act to define the boundaries of the Republic of Texas" approved 
19th December 1836, a copy of which is hereby furnished you.* 

These two last points you will regard as a sine gua non to any 
permanent treaty with Mexico; but if you find that it will aid you 
in the ultimate accomplishment of your objects, to negotiate a treaty 
of peace and recognition in the first instance, leaving the question 
of boundary to be subsequently settled in a general treaty of Amity' 
limits, commerce, navigation and intercourse, you are at liberty to 
form such a treaty; but in doing so, you must be careful that nothing 
appears in it which could by any possibility be construed into an 
intention on the part of this Government, to yield any portion of the 
Territory claimed by the Act of Congress to which I have already 
refer'd you. 

In negotiating a treaty, having for its inmiediate objects nothing 
farther than the restoration of peace, and the recognition of our 
Independence, it will be better if it can be done consistent with the 
claims of this Government, to define the limits at once, as by doing 
so, you will avoid much embarrassment and discussion in your 
future negotiations of a general treaty; you will therefore urge the 
subject as far as you can, without involving the risk of breaking off 
your present negotiations, and interrupting your future intercourse 
with the Government. 

Should Mexico express a willingness to establish peace, and recog- 
nize the Independence of Texas to the extent of her original bound- 
aries when forming a part of the Mexican Confederacy, but peremp- 
torily refuse to admit our claims to the entire territory embraced 
within the limits defined by the act of Congress, you may propose a 
compromise by negotiating for the purchase of all that portion of it 
which is not within the original boundaries, at a stipulated price; but 
the sum to be thus stipulated for it, must not exceed five Millions of 
dollars, and that sum must be made payable in not less than five 
equal annual instalments; the first instalment to be made payable in 
one year after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty. 

The five millions will be the ultimatum of your propositions for 
the purchase, and you will of course commence your negotiations 
with propositions of a much less sum, and payable at longer periods, 
but should you succeed in effecting the purchase for a sum not exceed- 
ing two Millions of dollars, you may, if you find it necessary, stipulate 
that the whole of that sum shall be paid in one year after the exchange 
of ratifications. 

It is understood that Genl. Santa Anna is again at the head of the 
Mexican Nation, and if so this must be a propitious moment for the

commencement of your negotiations. By a secret agreement made 
between him and the Cabinet of this Republic, at Velasco, on the 
14th May 1836, he promised that he would not take up arms himself, 
nor cause them to be taken up against the people of Texas during the 
War of Independence; that he would prepare the Cabinet of Mexico 
for the favorable reception of a Minister, through whose negotiations 
all differences might be settled, and the Independence of the Country 
acknowledged; and that a treaty of Commerce, Amity and limits 
should be established between the two Countries, the limits of Texas 
not to extend beyond the Rio Bravo dd Norte. 

This agreement stipulates for all that we ask, and as Genl. Santa 
Anna has once pledged himself to use his influence to carry it into 
effect, it is beUeved that it may be rendered very available by you, 
in the event of your finding him at the head of the Mexican Govern- 
ment, you are therefore furnished with a Copy of it." 

It is true, that the stipulation in this agreement, to send General 
Santa Anna at once to Vera Cruz, was not Utterally fulfiled on the 
part of the Texan Government at that time; and this may be urged 
as a reason for absolving him from the moral obligations which it 
impUes; but the causes of the non fulfilment of that stipulation are 
well known to you, and to him, and as they involve no want of faith on 
the part of this Government, but were forced upon it by uncontrolable 
circumstances, the moral force of the agreement is left wholly unim- 
paired; and more especially, as it was compUed with and enforced, as 
soon as it could be done consistently with the personal safety of Genl. 
Santa Anna. He was subsequently set at Hberty, and sent out of the 
country, in virtue of this very agreement, and in the only way which 
was deemed safe to himself, and conducive to the accomplishment of 
the objects contemplated by it. 

It is not contended by this Government that the agreement made 
with Genl. Santa Anna, while in this Country and a prisoner of war, is 
legally binding on the Mexican Government; but it is a well estab- 
Hshed principle of the law of Nations, that the person who makes 
promises under circumstances similar to those in which the President 
of the Mexican Republic was placed while here, is afterwards bound to 
use his Influence in causing those promises to be respected by his Gov- 
ernment, and that the Government itself is bound to make many sacri- 
fices rather than permit them to be violated. This principle of the 
law of Nations may be useful to you, in your negotiations, and I there- 
fore refer you in support of it, to Vattel and other writers on inter- 
national law. 

Besides, in asking for the fulfilment of the stipulations of this agree- 
ment, we do not believe that we are requiring any sacrifices on the

part of the Mexican Government which will not be more than made 
up to that country by the advantages which will result from the estab- 
lishment of peace and a friendly intercourse between the two nations. 
Apart from all the obUgations which it imposes there are weighty rea- 
sons for the acknowledgment of the Independence of Texas by Mexico, 
and for the forming a general treaty of amity, commerce, navigation 
and intercourse between the two countries, and these reasons may be 
ui^ed with pecuUar force in your negotiations. Among them are 1st. 
The entire dissimilarity in education, habits, manners, disposition, 
and pursuits of the Inhabitants of the two countries, and the utter 
impossibiUty of their ever assimilating and moving harmoniously 
together, if they were again united. 

2dly. The total incompatibiUty of ideas entertained by the people 
of the two Republics as to the pecuUar forms of Government best 
adapted to the wants and rights of Men. 

3dly. The conflicts which must inevitably grow out of this incom- 
patibilty of sentiment, and the injuries which would result from them 
if the Anglo Saxon race now inhabiting Texas should be again com- 
mingled under, the same form of Government with the Spanish race of 
Mexico. 

4thly. The inconvenience and worthlessness of Texas to Mexico on 
account of its remoteness from her Seat of Government, and the main 
body of the population; and also, on account of its contiguity to the 
United States of the North, where in any state of things, most of its 
intercourse must necessarily tend. 

5thly. The difficulties which Mexico would always experience in 
keeping the Indians bordering on Texas in check at so great a distance 
from them. 

6thly . The advantages which would necessarily result to both Coun- 
tries from a friendly intercourse and traffick, conducted in the spirit of 
a reciprocal kindness and harmony, and 

7thly. The disposition which Texas has manifested since the battle 
of San Jacinto to rely upon friendly negotiations for the settlement of 
her diflFerences with Mexico, rather than a farther resort to war, and 
the confidence which she has reposed in the promises of Genl. Santa 
Anna, made shortly after that battle. 

Had Texas been disposed to farther hostilities with Mexico, she has 
had a most inviting opportunity for invading that Country during the 
domestic conflicts by which it has been harassed on the one side, and 
the embarrassments produced by the French invasion ** on the other. 
This forbearance affords the strongest evidence of her desire for 
amity — a desire which nothing will destroy but an evident attempt to 
do her injustice and wrong.

These and other arguments which will suggest themselves to you, 
may possibly be used with much effect in your conferences with the 
persons who may be selected to negotiate with you. 

The President, aware of the great importance it is to the prosperity 
of this Country, that its differences with Mexico should be adjusted 
and a permanent peace established as early as possible, and not willing 
that any opportunity for the accomplishment of so desirable an object 
should be lost, has also furnished our Minister near the Government 
of the United States with plenary powers to treat for peace and Inde- 
pendence with the Mexican Minister at Washington, or with such other 
person as may be appointed to negotiate with him, should that Gov- 
ernment be induced, through the mediation of the United States, to 
open a negotiation at that City.* But the authority and instructions 
given to Genl. Dunlap on this subject, are not intended in the slightest 
degree to impair the powers given to you, or to lessen the efforts 
which you are expected to make in Mexico; on the Contrary, it is 
beUeved that the double Mission will have a tendency to accelerate 
the attainment of this most desired object, and that he, by invoking 
the mediatorial aid and influence of the United States, may mate- 
rially benefit you in your negotiations. 

He is therefore instructed to keep you advised of all important 
matters which may transpire at Washington, in reference to this 
subject, after he shall have been informed of your oflBcial reception 
at Mexico. 

You will also freely communicate with him respecting the affairs 
of your Mission, so that either may at all times be apprized of the 
course pursued by the other, and to prevent the subjects of your 
respective communications becoming known in the event of the mis- 
carriage of your despatches, you are each furnished with a corre- 
sponding cypher, in which all letters of business will be written. 
You will also cause your despatches to this Government to be made 
out on the same cypher. 

Knowing as little as we do of the real disposition of the Mexican 
Grovemment in regard to this, or of its feelings in respect to the 
people of this Country, no positive instructions can be given you as 
to the performance of the various duties which may devolve upon 
you. The foregoing views are offered more as suggestions to you, 
than as positive mandates. The cardinal points of your Mission are, 
the restoration of peace, the acknowledgment of the Independence of 
Texas, and the recognition of her limits as defined by the Act of 
Congress before refered to, all beyond this is left to your own judg- 
ment. You are well acquainted with the condition of this Country, 
its prospects, wishes, and expectations, and also of its ability to sus- 
tain itself in the event of a future conflict; and the President relying

A proposition for Peace is infinitely more likely to succeed emanat-

Mexican Grovt. DeloA/ upon so important a point may weU be 
endured — ^if the road is made plain which will lead to success. My

Dunlaps Mission should be suspended — but I only throw this out to 
you. I have been so chagrined that except for the success of Gen'l

My dear Sir, 

Genl Hamilton is now writing to our friend the President and will 
explain every thing in connection with our fiscal affairs. What would 
have become of us, if he had not come on ? I have all along endeav- 
ored to impress upon the Cabinet that Hamilton was the only man 
combining the inclination with the power of aiding Texas. I have had 
repeated conversations with Mr Saligny and other well informed per- 
sons here, and all agree if Gen4 Lamar wiU empower Hamilton to have 
an -interview conjointly with Genl Henderson at the Courts of Eng- 
land and France, that infinite good to Texas will result. The truth is — 
that he is now known abroad and favorably, and his merely coming 
forward in behalf of Texas wUl produce an effect of the most favorable 
aspect. Genl Hamilton knows nothing of my having written to you 
on this subject. I do so however from the conviction that good will 
result from the suggestion of others of its propriety and from the fact 
that Hamilton himself urged the propriety of it in a long private com- 
munication last year to Genl Houston. He told him then from the 
great influence he expected to have by his connexions in Europe he 
was satisfied he could aid Henderson essentially and that it would

will instantly communicate the arrival of the former and Mr. Breed- 
love the collector of this Port has assured me the latter shall be at 
my service the moment she arrives. Say to the President, he must 
not regret the delay, — it has enabled me to mingle with those having 
intimate relations with Mexico, and who are all writing to their 
friends in my behalf; but above all it has secured me the influence of 
the lAmrdVsy who are not only powerful in Mexico, but are the 
Agents of the Bcmd Jiddera in England. Mr Gordon of the House 
assures me he had repeated interviews last summer with Lord 
Palmerston upon the relations of Mexico and Texas, and that he is 
satisfied the letters he will now give me to Mr Packenham the British 
Minister to Mexico will insure my reception. He will call upon him 
in the strongest terms to urge Mexico to listen to Texas, as the best 
possible mode of the British subjects being secured in their interests.

obligations under which Mexico is to England will compel her not 
slightly to treat Mr Fackenham. The Lizardi's, (Mr Forstall and 
Mr Gordon known to Mr La Branch, who see) think too [that the 
proposal to negotiate is] the more highly creditable to Genl. Lamar, 
and will tend to place him on high ground in Europe, and insure 
General Hamilton's success. They say they could hardly have 
expected so much /or6 cast in so young a Gentleman. My delay too 
will probably furnish me with letters from Mr Poinsett and the British 
Minister at Washington. The Padre " is here willing to aid in every 
way. Col. White thinks he will be of much benefit; I doubt his 
Oovemmental influence, but as a Catholic Priest I have no doubt he 
will be of service. I bear all his expenses, I suspect he has not a full 
purse. 

Mr. Forstall assures me secret money is indispensable. I have 
just received a letter from General Hamilton on his journey (written 
with a view of its being seen by Santa Anna or who ever may be in 
power) that any promises I may make, he will see fulfilled in 
Philadelphia. 

Write to me to the care of the Lizardi's, and should I have left, 
they will forward it to Mexico. A vessel sails in a day or two belong- 
ing to them, but they advise my going in a National Vessel, — and

Sir, 

I received Mr Seabring very courteously as coming from the 
President. A Secretary however, ought always to have the con- 
fidence of the Gentleman with whom he is associated and therefore 
I wished Mr Amory; since Mr Seabrings arrival, facts have come to 
my knowledge relative to his affairs in Mexico which compelled me 
instantly to inform him that it was impossible he should accompany 
me. The mission is a delicate one, and nothing calculated to mar 
it in the remotest degree ought to exist. I shall obtain an inter- 
preter through the English or American Legation, which will answer 
my purpose fully, — and then if Mr Amory can be spared he can 
follow me. You had better wait a letter from me on my arrival. 
I have had a letter from Commodore Dallas announcing the arrival 
of the Warren. I will get particulars tomorrow. I am all ready, 
tho should have been glad to have taken the Washington letters 
with me. Mr Forstall will send them to me however. I take with 
me a letter from his house (Lizardi) to Mr Packenham which wiU 
have its weight, warm letters from the Merchants engaged in the 
Mexican business, and a capital letter from General Gaines to Santa 
Anna himself. By the bye, the news papers give an account of his 
instalment as President. Strange Govt ! Bust amenta will put down

son it has been intimated through the Bishop (Padre Muldoon" 
who I assure you has evinced the utmost anxiety) and the American 
Consul, that upon my stating that this vessel was about to sail, and 
that I should have no domicil, that General Victoria would inform 
me I could take rooms in the city. I accordingly infonned him I 
had only to claim the hospitality of the French, or be indebted to 
him, until the Secretary of State of Mexico could be heard from, 
observing at the same time, I left it entirely optional \\dth him 
which course was to be pursued, but that if allowed to have rooms 
in Vera Ouz, I should feel bound to comply with such regulations

the "El Censor'' the day before after abusing the Texians said "if the 
Fellow attempts to land a prison awaits him"

with great frankness. The moment he heard of my arrival he 
assured me he had communicated with Mexico by express, thought 
he should very soon know the result, and Tioped aU vxruM he weU!

nature of my instructions in order if they proved satisfactory, the 
cue might be given to the Mexican Congress before my arrival. I 
informed the Agent that having already communicated with the 
Secretary of State, and my arrival universally known, I should 
reserve myself for his ear. Indeed I am very glad he did not meet 
me in New Orleans, I greatly prefer treating openly with these people.

Dear Sir, 

The foregoing is a copy of a letter addressed to Oeneral Hamilton. 
I hope that before I can receive a reply to it, the funds mentioned by 
Col. Bee will have arrived. I will avail myself then of the first oppor- 
tunity to reach the City of Mexico — as there will probably not be a 
vessel for Vera Cruz very soon, I will go either to Tampico or Matamo- 
ras, if I should think I can gain time by doing so. 

Mr. Forstall is the active partner of the House of Lizardi & Co 
highly influential in Mexico, and his co-operation will have a great 
tendency to bring about an arrangement between the two coimtries. 
He told me that he had paved the way for Col Bee, and that no doubt 
an arrangement could be effected on the basis of the acknowledge- 
ment of our independence. He has allowed me to inform his Excel- 
lency Genl. Lamar, that he had just received news from the highest 
authorities to that effect. 

I forwarded by the vessel which sailed yesterday a letter received 
some few days ago from yourself to Col Bee. Should you have any 
further commands, I am afraid that the return of the Columbia will 
still find me here, waiting an answer from Genl. Hamilton. 

I am sorry to see Jime so near, as the rainy season commences in

agreeable. I want to be off. * * * <»

Vera Cruz, May S4ih 1839 
Honl 

James Webb 

Secretary of State 
My Dear Sir, 

Repeated communications have passed between General Victoria 
and the Government since my arrival. My letter requesting to be 
allowed to present myself at Mexico clothed with important communi- 
cations from Texas, was immediately laid before the Coimcil, and 
unanimously rejected, '*if independence was my object". Private 
letters were received stating I would be ordered to the Castle etc etc. 
In the mean time General Victoria continued to treat me with marked 
attention, and I have just left him after an hours conversation. He 
says the acknowledgment of our Independence is out of the question; 
that Zacatecas, Sonora etc would soon be asking the same thing. I 
replied we were a different people, speaking a different language etc, 
while these states with a good Oovemment would seek no change. He 
then urged, that Texas should at once propose to be reunited with 
Mexico, that she should be received with open arms, the past for- 
gotten. I replied, that his proposition was a flattering one but that 
Mexico was now a Central Government, when Texas was attached to 
a Federal. He said she was a Representative Republic that Texas as 
a Department would have a right to be represented etc etc. I told 
him, Texas was valueless without Slaves, and that imder his constitu- 
tion. Slavery could not exist. He replied, that can be got over. 
Congress would assent to Texas holding them etc. In fine nothing 
could exceed his desire that we should come into thQ fold. He then 
went on, The French question is settled, the Federalists are put down, 
reform about to take place, and that with the great resources at com- 
mand, Mexico would be compelled to wage an efficient War upon 
Texas, That companies from Europe with arms in their hands were 
ready to locate, only waiting the word, that utter annihilation awaited 
us, unless we came in. I replied, we were aware of their power, eight 
Millions of people, that for defence, I had no doubt of their prowess. 
But to his people in the aggregate, Texas offered not an inducement, 
that a laurel could never be gained there, that the province was 
remote — to get his soldiers there he would have to take them in 
chains, — that the war would cost them more than Texas was worth, 
and that after all we would retain it, — for the moment our standard 
floated in the breeze, the young of all nations would flock to it, and

that with an exhausted Treasury and a heavy debt, I thought they 
had better listen to my proposals. We of course did not convince 
each other and I only give you the conversation to show how strenu- 
ously devoted to the reunion the old gentleman is. He even asked if 
I did not think I could persuade my Government to alter her views. 
"Remember'', said he, "what an old man tells you. Mexico is the 
finest country in the world; avail yourself of its advantages, at a 
future day your son may be at her head." 

But as to Santa Anna, We must give him time, — at this moment he 
does not dare take a move openly in favor of Texas. He is playing a 
great game. The press is put down. The Militia of the country 
disarmed. Soldiers are pressed into the Service. Mexia's followers 
made to fall in the ranks. Captains reduced to privates. Bonapart's 
conscription adopted. Despotism covers the land, and imtil he is 
firmly seated as Emperor, nothing will be done. In the mean time 
he will Jiedor about Texas, (and in secret will negotiate with her), 
keep Bustamenta at the head of the Army etc — thus the mission has 
failed. 

Texas must prepare for war, but with little probability of ever 
being invaded. I would not call a single farmer from his plough; let 
the soil be cultivated; you want population. Volunteers from all 
nations will flock to you. Ten thousand Germans, ten thousand 
French, — give moderate bounties in land, have a good Commissariaty 
and you need not give a dollar pay during the time they are in service, 
and with a moderate navy you have nothing to fear. All this will be 
the duty of the Government, — but I tell you the question is settled; 
Texas will be heard. I ought not to have come here; Washington 
was the place to open the subject. While I write, the secret Agent is 
in my view. I have had nothing to do with him except to gather all 
I could. The British Minister at Mexico will say to Santa Anna, you 
are going against the Wind Mills in Texas, pray pay us before you 
start etc etc 

I leave by the first opportunity, my services you know are at the 
disposal of the President, from a volunteer in the army to a fireside 
counsellor. I will proceed on my reaching Orleans to Pendleton 
S. C. and will expect to hear from you there, as there will be ample 
time to return to Texas. 

I have communicated with Mr Packenham and expect to hear 
from him. I have yet to tell you of the fate of the Padre Muldoon. 
As soon as he reached Mexico, I am told he was incarcerated, for 
coming with a Texian. He is said to have been imprudent on his 
journey, praising the Texians, and saying their Minister must be 
received, but I rather apprehend his difficulty has arisen from having 
left the palace against the consent of Bustamenta. He obtained, it 
seems a passport from Santa Anna.

Mt Deab Sm, 

I have just received your letter of the 6th May. I havnt time to 
write a line, though I have very much to say. We made a merry 
move in coming so suddenly upon these people, the first plan was the 
true one It ought to have opened at Washington. I have been 
most courteously received by General Victoria, but the Government 
cannot recognize me, so that Mexico has denied me. I have received 
a polite note from the Secretary of State headed particular and confi' 
dential, I have also recvd. one from Mr Packenham saying nothing 
can be done at this rruyment I have proposed to open my views at 
Washington. They will either send Almonte to me there, or refer me 
to Mr Martinez. 

As yet the letters from the British Minister and the Mexican Min- 
ister (Martinez) at Washington, have not reached Mexico; they 
arrived to day. The House of lizardi write me they are most satis- 
factory. If I had where to lay my head, I would not leave yet, but 
the Steamer goes in the morning, the fleet follow on Saturday, and 
there is neither an American or English vessel of war here. But in 
truth, we must give Santa Anna a litUe Hme, — ^not alone Santa Anna 
but the whole Govmt. 

General Victoria told me he would receive us with open arms, if we 
would only come into the fold again, — be reunited with Mexico!! 

I will furnish you with copies of all I have written, but cannot pos- 
sibly now; I had no knowledge of a vessel for New Orleans. The 
Captain told me he was bound for New York, but would take me to 
the BaUze for 500$. If on my arrival at the Havana, I find a vessel 
ready for Orleans, I will pay you a visit in Texas, if not I will go to 
Charleston as I have named the 1st July for opening the subject at 
Washington. Tell Genl. Lamar I will carry it through, but if not we

My Dear Sir,^— 

I deem it proper to apprize you, of my movements here to second 
Col. Bee's movements in Mexico, which I consider for obvious reasons 
suspended not broken off. The truth is that the negotiation could 
not have been conducted in Mexico, but must from the troubled State 
of Mexico be transferred to the United States. With several prov- 
inces in a state of revolt, Santa Anna could not set the example in 
his own capital of a recognition of the Independence of one which 
they are pleased to consider in a State of Rebellion. On my arrival 
at the North I repaired to Washington and immediately commenced 
a series of operations to get the Government of the United States 
warmly enlisted in co-operating in effecting peace between Mexico 
and Texas. The President gave Mr Ellis special instructions and 
carried his courtesy so far, as to order the Frigate Constitution 
detained five days, to take out Mr Pakenham's dispatches from Mr 
Fox. These dispatches earnestly recommending to Mr. Pakenham 
the poUcy of his using his best efforts with Santa Anna, to consent 
to a recognition of Texas and Treaty of peace, were in consequence 
of my addressing to Mr. Fox, a letter of which the enclosed is a copy.** 
I also have sent you a copy of Mr. Fox's reply.* Mr. Poinsett, who 
is the decided and warm friend of Texas, has been industriously occu- 
pied in getting Martinez the Mexican Minister at Washington earnestly

engaged in urging peace in his distracted and infatuated country. I 
send you a copy of Mr. Poinsetts letter to me disclosing what Martinez 
has done. There is a Gentleman in New York, a cordial friend of 
Texas, named Treat,* who has been many years in Mexico is inti- 
mately acquainted with Santa Anna and corresponds with a close 
friend of the Mexican President, from whom he has received several 
letters lately, translations of which, I have seen, in which this person 
represents that he is amply empowered by Santa Anna, to conclude 
the secret articles of a pacification. This person has communicated 
with Col Bee, in Novr.^ in New Orleans, and I hope to induce Mr. 
Treat, to go down to New Orleans, early next week, to see what can 
be done. He may essentially aid Col Bee and the negotiation may 
be transferred to Washington under the mediation of the United 
States. You see now how affairs stand. I beUeve very Uttle money 
comparatively [will' be needed] for the attainment of such an object. 
Your administration may be illustrated by the recognition of France, 
England and Mexico, and a negotiation of the five MilUon Loan, and 
all this before the meeting of your congress, and next winter through 
the instrumentaUty of the Bank of the United States, you may have 
a better currency than United States now possesses. I have dis- 
closed in Mr. Burnley's and my oflBicial letter *^ the importance of 
changing the bonds and the sinking funds basis, but we cannot nego- 
tiate them without we can obtain your concurrence in the sinking 
fund act. If you approve of the same you will.be so kind as to 
indorse your approval on the transcript, and forward it by my son, 
directed to me, to the care of Palmer's, McKellop, Dent & Co London. 
Without the recognition however, of Great Britain, we can have no hope 
of success, and this can only be obtained by getting that of France 
first, which for money we can accomplish. We have pressed this 
point as a matter of diplomatic Service, and your consideration and 
hope to obtain your Sanction. What New Country can win Empire 
and Independence without the use of Sinews of War, and the Currency 
of peace, which money may well be called. Let me however entreat 
you to dispatch my Son back to New Orleans with all imaginable 
haste, as Mr. Burnley and myself cannot proceed a step in the nego- 
tiation of the loan imtil we get your sanction of the sinking fund act. 

a Conoeming James TreAt, little farther can be stated here than is learned from this oorrespondence. He 
came tram New York to Texas in the summer of 1830 bearing letters of recommendation from N. T. Jen- 
nings, James Hamilton and Barnard E. Bee to Burnet; and John T. Mason and R. O. Dunlap to Lamar 
(See Records of Department of State, Texas, Book 41, pp. 297-298). One of these letters states that he 
is "intimately acquainted with Mexico and Mexican Politics, having passed much of his time there, and 
enjoyed the confidence of the leading men of the Country." He gave material help to Texas in New York 
in 1836 (See Tdegraph and Texas Register , December 16, 1840) and was its confidential agent in Mexico, 
1839-1840. He died on his passage from Vera Cruz to Galveston, November 30, 1840. 

b There is certainly an error in this date, which must be due to the copyist's inexi>ertne8s and to Ham- 
ilton's puzzling chirography. The interviews of Bee with the secret agent of the Mexican government in 
New Orleans took place in July. See Bee to Webb, July 6, 1839.

My Deab Sib 

I did not receive your letter until late last night, and therefore 
could not reply to it by return of Mail as desired. I received from 
our mutual friend Col Barnard Bee a letter requesting that I should 
furnish him with letters to my friends in Mexico and take an interest 
in the success of his Mission, the object of which he explained to me. 
The real interest I have felt for Texas induced me to decline giving 
him letters, as they could be of no service to him, and might have 
excited suspicion among the most suspicious people on earth, both 
with regard to the views of this Government, and the part I might 
take individually in the recognition of Texian Independence. In an 
interview which I had subsequently with Mr. Martinez, I found him 
very favourably impressed with the views of mutual advantage to 
Mexico and Texas, likely to result from the proposed arrangement. 
In consequence chiefly of his own reflections and enlightened views 
of the subject, he wrote a pressing letter to Seflor Gorostiza, which 
he communicated to me, urging the acceptance of the offers he under- 
stood Col Bee was authorized to make. 

I have not time to detail to you the arguments adduced in the 
letter, but they were such as would occur to the friends of both 
countries and especially of Mexico, and were ably and cogently 
urged, so much so, that I entertain great hopes, they will have pro- 
duced beneficial results, and lead to the favorable termination of 
the Negotiation. I will take up the business you left me here next 
week, and dispatch it

Hamu^ton to Lamar/ 

(Private and Confidential) New York June 28th. 18S9 

My Dear Sir. — 

This will be handed you by the Gentleman to whom I refered 
in my letter to you by my son — ^Mr. James Treat of this City — whom 
I beg leave to introduce to your confidence and acquaintance. Mr. 
Treat has resided many years in Mexico and is intimately acquainted 
with most of the leading public men of that country, and withal 
speaks its language fluently. He is well acquainted with Santa 
Anna, and is the correspondent of the Italian Gtentlemen, the agent 
of Santa Anna, who had an interview with Mr Bee at Vera Cruz and 
who is now in New Orleans, and who has invited Mr. Treat to join 
him there for the purpose of ascertaining what privately can be done 
to produce a speedy public pacification between Texas and Mexico 
As it is due to Col Bee, Mr. Treat distinctly understands he is to act 
under the instructions of Col Bee, and in subordination to his views. 
As I think after your Minister has had all the trouble and peril of 
the Mission he ought to have whatever honor may arise from its 
successful issue. 

The great point to be gained is that Mexico may concur to the 
mediation of the United States and that the negotiation may be 
transfered to Washington with as little delay as possible. Mr. 
Treat or his friend in New Orleans, (Santa Anna's agent) will repair 
after a proper understanding, with Col Bee on all points (under your 
instructions) to Vera Cruz if necessary, after all the facts are known 
between the contracting parties. The vast importance of having the 
fact officially known in London, that Mexico agrees to the mediation 
of the United States, and that the negotiation is transfered to 
Washington, cannot be overestimated in the business confided to 
my hands. Now as great Secrecy, Vigilance and dispatch are nec- 
essary in this highly momentous affair, Col Bee cannot have a more 
efficient and faithful adjunct than Mr Treat, or a safer counsellor. 
His character is most highly vouched by gentlemen who have my 
confidence, and their favorable opinions are entirely confirmed by 
my own observation. Mr. Treat starts 'post, and will repair to New 
Orleans, and after seeing his friend, will repair to Texas, to see you 

a June 24, 1839 (esrtract). See Bee to Webb, July 6, 1839.

This will be handed you by James Treat Esqr. who is the bearer of

thought it best to make them payable to yours, as some accident on 
the Boat, might either detain or prevent my son from reaching New 
Olreans. I wish you would be particular and verify * the order from 
the Texian Government, to deUver the notes, examining whether 
addressed to the President or Cashier of the Merchants Bank, or to 
Thomas Lynch Hamilton. You will likewise oblige me by saying to 
the Texian Agent, that it would be contrary to the understanding 
imder which they were received, that they should be cashed at a 
discount, or hawked about the market in New Orleans, as they are 
lent exclusively for the purpose of purchasing supplies for the Indian 
Campaign,* and can be used at par for such purchases, as thos^ sell- 
ing provisions or munitions of War, will gladly receive them as a cash 
equivalent. It would be well for you to say to the Texian Agent 
that he had better, for safety keep the notes on deposit in the Mer-

I left Havana on the 12th inst, in the Roger WiUiams, for New

Baudin who, I find perfectly charmed with you all. By the bye, he 
says, if not ordered to France, he wiU go to Texas, take horses and 
ride over the country. I have assured him, the President would 
furnish him with every facility.

The letters I received from the Lizardi's, just as I was leaving, 
would have justified my remaining, if I had had where to lay my head, 
but the French Fleet were to sail for Campeachy on Saturday, and 
there was not an English or American Grovernment Vessel there. 
There were a few American and Spanish Merchant sloops, but I felt 
it would neither be compatible with the honor of Texas, or my own 
respectibility that I should be shifting from Craft to craft, and there- 
fore, at once proposed to the Secretary of State of Mexico, that he 
should appoint an agent to meet me at Washington, if they were dis- 
posed to open the negotiation. I wait with infinite anxiety to know 
the result upon my arrival at New Orleans. 

My letter to you written in great haste, the night before I left Vera 
.Cruz, gave you my impressions then without having informed you of 
any preliminary steps! These, you will discover in my letter of the 
24th May now sent you. On the whole, ''doubt not but success will 
fashion the event in better shape than I can lay it down in llkeU- 
hood." Indeed, have no fears, — say to Genl. Johnston prepare 
moderately, but to be assured he will never have a Mexican Army to 
contend with. They have no Navy: they have not a dollar in their 
Treasury: they have not paid their Officers or men for years: they 
owe Great Britain 60 MiUion of dollars: they are paying France 
200 000 dollars every two months: how? by borrowing of the Mer- 
chants at 40 per cent discoimt and giving orders on the Custom 
Houses. The American Minister Judge Ellis is to receive monthly 
from the custom house so much, — and if not, then Juxlf the amoimt. 
Where then are they to get money to annihilate Texas ? Sir the ques- 
tion is settled. 

New Orleans July 6th 18S9. 

On my arrival I foimd a letter from Col. Almonte saying ''I was 
desired hy the President to open my views," the very point they had 
refused. Had I received this letter on board the Fleet, I would 
immediately have obtained r^-admission into Vera Cruz, but it is 
best as it is. I am satisfied Washington will be a better atmosphere, 
than Mexico. I am hourly expecting the Vessel from Vera Cruz. 

Mr Hammekin wiQ be the bearer of this commimication. I send 
him in order that the President may sanction my proceeding to Wash- 
ington, and extend my instructions should he deem it advisable, but 
they are so full and so admirably drawn, that I do not think you will 
have much more trouble. 

I foimd Texas money at 28 cents on reaching here. I instantly 
went to the Brokers and told them it was intrinsically worth 75 cents, 
and that there was every probability of our commissioners succeeding 
in Europe; to day it is 40 cents, and the moment it is known, that you 
have an advance, as it must be, through the Bank, it will be higher. 
If the Banks of this city were worth a farthing (and they are not) I

would have obtained One hundred thousand Dollars, and bought up 
all our money — for the Govemment — and even now, I would suggest 
the Secretary of the Treasiuy sending Col Love by the return of the 
Columbia, with authority to do so. Of course it will be enhanced, 
but many thousand dollars will be gained by the operation. Mr. 
Bryan** the Consul, might be authorised: I have found him very 
solicitous to forward the interests of Texas

Orleans 6th July 39 
My dear Sir, 

I am in receipt of two letters by express from Gen'l Hamilton of 
the 23d and 24th June. The last says, " My Son left Philadelphia 
" yesterday Ev'g at 6 o.c'k for New Orleans. He will reach there by 
"the 4th July. Do not let the Steam Boat leave without him, as 
" he has important despatches for your Govt, and ought to return 
" in time for their advices to be forwarded by the Great Western on 
"the 1st. August." He adds, — ^'^ Remain yourself in Orleans until 
" Mr Treat arrives, as he will convey to you very important inf orma- 
"tion from me. Mr Treat is the correspondent of Santa Anna's 
" agent now in New Orleans and will act in subordination to your 
" views. It may be necessary to send this agent to Mexico for de- 
" spatches authorising you to negotiate under the mediation of the 
" United States. Write me weekly that I may use every auspicious 
" incident beneficially." 

I am very much in hopes the letters I wrote the night preceding my 
leaving the French Fleet will accomplish all that Genl. Hamilton 
seems to desire, and I have little doubt that the first vessel from 
Vera Cruz will satisfy us upon this point. The calms at this Season 
detain her I presume. The Secret Agent alluded to by Gen'l Hamil- 
ton, and of whom I wrote from Vera Cruz is daily with me. I play 
him off under the plea that I am in direct correspondence with the 
Sec'y of State, Mr. Gorostiza, but he assures me until I make myself 
felt nothing positive will be effected. Gten'l Hamilton is so satisfied 
of this, that he says he had reserv'd money for me, but that as I have 
returned I must draw upon you. I think Five Thousd Dollars will 
be enough for the present. I will thank you to send me an order 
for this Am't through Mr Forstall of the House of Lizardi. I

Intrst. frm Deer 1836 in favor of the Washington City Bank. It 
was for money advanced by the Bank to Col. Hockley and myself 
on the Santa Anna Expedition. It would be very unpleasant to me 
to go to Washington with this dr'ft unpaid. The letter to the Dept. 
I presume points out when the money is to be remitted. I am very 
sure you will attend to this for me.

Haioltok to Lamar.' 

New York July 8th. 1839 
Mt Dear Sir 

The day previous to my intending to sail in the Steamer Liver- 
pool, I received an intimation from a respectable Quarter that if I 
would either see or write to Martinez the Mexican Minister privately 
before the 1st. Augst. that I would receive a pretty unequivocal 
assurance that Mexico was prepared to accept the mediation of the 
United States. I deemed this too important a lever in my negotia- 
tion to hesitate one moment, about it, more especially as Saligny, 
did not until to day receive the permission of his Government to 
take his report * in person to France. Hence he could not sail in 
the Liverpool, but goes with me in the Great Western, on the first of 
August as I am inclined to stick to him until we obtain the recogni- 
tion of Louis Philipe. As Mr. Shaw has gone over to lay the pre- 
liminary basis for our negotiation, and from his knowledge as an 
old and experienced Banker, is acquainted with all the capitalists in 
London and is thoroughly in our interest, I will lose nothing, or 
your Government, by the delay. Besides the London Stock Market 
is very much depressed at the present, and until the produce of 
another harvest, in England, is realized, which will not be until 
September we cannot expect any improvement. We have such strong 
friends, and our loan is so well arranged and got up, that I have 
confident hopes of success by the 1st. October, and especially if we 
are able to obtain the recognition of Louis Philipe, of which I enter- 
tain no doubt, with the application of the proper means. I hope 
you have received the dispatches by my son, with the checks for 
80,000$ likewise the Post Notes by Mr. Treat, which he was in- 
structed to leave with the cashier of the Merchants Bank, subject to 
your order. 

I will write you again, in the course of a few days. In the mean 
time be assured of the constant esteem, with which I am, Very 
Respectfully and faithfully, your friend, and Obt. Servant 

J. Hamilton 
His Excellency 

MiRABEAU B Lamar 

Prest. of the Republic of Texas 

P. S. If Mr. Treat should as a private individual without any 
oflScial sanction from your people go to Vera Cruz to see Santa Anna 
I would strongly recommend you to let him go, and ascertain the 
disposition of the Mexican Government.

Merchants Bank 
Orleans 9th July 1839. 
My dear Sir, 

I have exerted every nerve to expedite Mr Reily. You had not 
notified this Bank that you expected funds, and on their arrival, they 
proved to be post Notes payable at 6 months^ which for purchases of 
supplies etc will prove as good as cdsh^ but for procuring Silver, 
which was indispensable to Mr. Reily was a different thing. But this 
was not all. The Bank was only authorised to deliver to the order of 
Gen'l Lamar the two hundred thousand Dollars^ and were he to send 
an order to Morrow for that amH they would be obliged to pay it. 
Hence, I had to get them to advance me Twenty Seven Thousand Dol- 
lars in their Bills, and with this went into the Market and bought 
Silver. The Secy of the Treasury therefore in drawing will recollect 
to do so from the Am't less $27ft00. He will also be good enough to 
sanction what I have done and to empower the Bank to pay them- 
selves their discount on the Am't advanced, but upon this point the 
President of the Bank has written to Gen'l Lamar. The Sc'y of the 
Treasury will also be good enough to forward me a drf 't to cover the 
Am't I have paid for Lisurance to Nachitoches, for the purchase of 
Silver, for boxes, and for voyage. Amts to $250. I will send the re- 
ceipts. Texas will have to give me a domain at Austin. I am always 
on the stretch for her. Upon reflection, I determined to keep young 
Hamilton, as there was little chance of any thing being gained by 
taking a Schooner. He will be with you by the Columbia — having 
arrived just too late for her last trip. You will be pleased with the 
form of the bond sent on by his Father. Mr. Treat arrived to day 
and will visit you. The Secret Agent has been with me as I wrote 
ever since my arrival — unknown ojs such even to Mr Hammeken who 
knew him in Mexico and saw him daily here. He did not wish to be 
known unless I acknowledged him, which I did not wish to do until 
I heard from Mexico, as I was in direct correspondence with the Scy 
of State Gorostiza. The Water Witch that I have been so anxiously 
waiting for arrived to day brin'g me but one letter from Almonte, and 
written supposing I was still in Vera Cruz. He says, "you are 
" authorised to open your views to the Gov't in writing, as I com- 
" municated to you in my last letter," and adds " I am requested by 
" the Presid't to say Padre Muldoon was not imprisoned because he 
" accompanied you but because he left Mexico for Texas without au- 
" thority.'* Now My dear Sir, I assure you the Padre left expressly 
with Santa Annas authority — as he showed me his passport. The 
truth is he was imprisoned for accompanying me, but merely for

effect. They are a sharp People. The Secret Agent has rece'd full 
communications from the person behind the scene. He says — ^" There 
will be no difficulty — ^no matter who is at the head of Gov't — ^but it 
can only be approached in one way, and it may be tried in any other 
in vain." Gen'l Hamilton and Mr Poinsett are so aware of this that 
Mr Treat of New York has been sent to me as the most proper person 
to visit Mexico and prepare the way. The truth is the officers of 
Gov't are only waiting for their fee to commence operations. I was 
aware of this at Vera Cruz but I was solicitous of breaking ground 
without it — fully sensible however, that as I progressed the way 
would have to be paved with gold. The Presidents best plan is to 
make up his mind to this at once, and to empower me to use my dis- 
cretion, tho indeed I think he has long since done so. It was with 
this view I wrote the other day for authority to draw $5000 to com- 
mence with.* My impression is that he will have to spend from Five 
Hundred thous'd to a Million in this way, but still I hope to do it out 
of the Five Million ; in other words to make the Five Million effect 
aU objects. I shall offer them Silver instead of our bonds. I would 
accompany Mr Treat but really have nothing to add and am greatly 
in hopes by going to Pensacola, I shall meet the Constitution, who 
will bring answers to letters carried out by Judge Ellis. Notwith- 
standing Tomell's * proclamation I pray the President not to incur any 
very large expense for the Mexican 60 Thousand Warriors as I assure 
him he will never be on the field of battle with them again. Santa 
Anna has only done it as a blind, and to convince them that the " cal- 
umny " of his hav'g promised Two Million to Texas for his liberty 
is unfounded. I have never explained to you why I did not propose 
an Armistice. I found they were so elated at the departure of the 
French and the putting down the Federalists, that they would have 
attributed it to apprehension on our part, so that of course, I never 
named it. On the contrary, I always took high, but courteous ground 
with them. Almonte, as you are aware returned from England, 
about a fortnight before I arrived at Vera Cruz. I assure you he 
wrote — ^''that he was afraid Lord Palmerston would acknowledge 
Texas." He failed you know in procuring a dollar. I have just had 
an interview with a Mr Wright ^ who says he is a Texian Citizen and 
has given information to the Scy of War relative to our Indians.

He assures me they are all restive, and require close watching. He 
thinks the U. S. Indians would't require much to induce them to 
sweep our praries, but apprehends nothing further at present. He 
is on his way to Mexico and means to be promptly on the Rio Grande 
with a view of kn'w'g all their movements. He proffer his services 
to keep us constantly advised, and wishes to know if we will recom- 
pense him. I have assured him he will be compensated according to 
the importance and accuracy of his information. I am indeed not 
sorry to have met this man, if he is worthy. We ought to have at 
this moment an individual who will keep us informed of all Mexico's 
steps. 

Every thing ought to be done now to bring our currency at par. It 
would be a great relief to the officers of Gov't as well as to the Com- 
munity at large, but on this subject I need not say a word. 

I commenced this letter in the Merchants Bank three days ago,, 
expecting young Hamilton would have got off that night. I close it 
now, as a vessel is to leave to night and may arrive before the 
Columbia. 

I am sure you will be anxious to hear from me, and at all events

Orleans July 1839 



My dear Sir, 

I am happy to inform you the Merchants Bank rendered every 
facility in settling with Mr La Branche by giving their own notes 
and discounting your Post Notes as before. You may suppose this a 
trifling circumstance to them, but in the present "tight" state of 
things it is not so. Forty Thousand Dollars in the course of a few 
days for Texas not only deprived them of accomodating their Cus- 
tomers, but rendered them liable to be called upon for Silver. The 
Cashier will write to the President.*^ The Citizens Bank — ^Mr La 
Branche's — would have taken the Post Notes as Silver if they had 
three instead of six months to run, but we are fortunate to have had 
them at all. For all purcJiases as I wrote you they will pass as Cash. 
My last letter by Mr Sanderson will have shewn you that I had no 
idea of going on to Washington until I heard from Vera Cruz. This 
was my proposition to them, you know the night prior to my leav'g 
and as the same thing has been recommended to them from Wash- 
ington City, I have little doubt it will be acceded to. The Secret 
Agency is a distinct thing. It is merely to let them understand what 
we require and to assure them that if they enter warmly upon it we 
will not be wanting in making them ample compensation. It was 
for this I wanted the drf't to commence with. I wish to give the 
Individual here a doceur^ and I am desirous of sending an officer of 
their Gro't a handsome carriage from this place. His name I enclose 
you exclusively for the Presidents ear. 

I have been provoked at the appearance in the Houston Star of a 
letter said to have been rec'd from me. I wrote no such letter, but 
" that Gren'l Hamilton was sanguine of success and that his son was 
expected with important despatches for the Gov't " — and this I openly 
s'd — as I found your currency was sinking daily, and no persons de- 
crying it more than Mr Irion and Mr Beile, who were yet secretly

I received late last night your several letters by Mr. Hammekin, 
and as the last boat for the Columbia will leave this morning, I have 
only time to give you a very short and hasty reply. I have had 
a conversation with the President on the subject of your communica- 
tions, and he directs me to say, that in the present uncertain state of 
our relations with Mexico, he knows of no additional instructions 
which can be given you. He can perceive no necessity for your 
proceeding to Washington, imless it be under an express assurance 
from the Mexican Government, that an agent will be sent to that 
place authorized to treat with you directly in reference to the 
acknowledgement of the Independence of this Country, as every thing 
that can be done towards securing the interposition of the United 
States Government and the British Minister has already been done 
by General Dunlap. They are both willing to interpose, and have 
already done so, as far as propriety in the present State of the 
negotiation will permit, and further applications to them at present 
would be unavailing. 

Would it not be better for you to remain in New Orleans until 
you ascertain distinctly what course the Mexican Government intends 
pursueing? And if they are disposed to send a special agent to treat 
with you, could you not carry on the negotiation with that Agent at 
New Orleans better than at Washington? By remaining at New 
Orleans you would not only have an opportunity of availing your- 
self of the services of the lizardi's which might be beneficial, but 
you could at any time communicate witii the Government as to new

points which might arise in the discussion. Besides, it would at 
the same time be more convenient to the Mexicait Agent, as the 
facilities for communication with his Government would be much 
greater from New Orleans than from Washington. 

As regards the money of which you speak, the President says, until 
he knows their demands he is wholly unprepared to act ; and on that 
account it would probably be better for your negotiation to be con- 
ducted at New Orleans, if they are disposed to negotiate at all. 

I am not now the Secretary of State and am only acting tem- 
porarily in the absence of Judge Burnet, but it will at all times afford

My dear Sir, 

The sight of Mr Packenhams handwriting quite excited me just 
now. I was in hopes it was in reply to my communication written 
the night preceding my departure from Vera Cruz and that it would 
be full of intelligence, it proved however, to be of old date June 2d 
and reached here to day via Havanna. It states, that in compliance 
with my request — ^" he had taken an interest in Padre Muldoon and 
had every reason to believe he would be released from confinement 
in a few days." Mr Packenham — though he does not so write to 
me, — thinks, we must not despair of reconciliation from Mr Bees 
first rejection — ^that we have only to play our cards well to succeed — 
that strong prejudices are to be over come and that a little patience 
on our part will effect much. lie thinks hostilities ought to cease — 
in other words [there should be] an armistice; this is pretty much 
the tenor of his letter, and I give it to you exclusively for the Presi- 
dent and his Cabinet. 

I have before explained to you why I did not propose an armistice. 
In the first place, I did not wish to open my views to Gen'l Victoria, 
and in the 2d I found they were too elated at hav'g got rid of the 
French Fleet, and at put'g down the Federalists, and I therefore 
thought they might attribute the proposition to fear pi the Great 
Nation and still rejoice that I did not do it. I am as sanguine as 
ever that Peace will be the result, and if the first arrangment had 
been allowed — ^viz, my open'g the negotiation through the U. S. Gov't 
at Washington and giv'g tJiem as the Guarantee for all we pro- 
posed — infinite anxiety (God knows on my part) would have been

saved, but perhaps the question will be sooner settled by the course 
that has been ta4cen. The whole nation knows that we have tendered 
Peace, and it will have its influence. We have many friends among 
them, and there is a strong party that would rise in our favor should 
War unfortunately take place. There are Mexicans here with Silver 
who have traversed Texas and come down the Red River. They 
passed near "Austin " and the day is not distant when that place will 
take the trade. They say they were not interrupted by Texians or 
Indians. I have sent to ascertain what their feelings are towards us 
and whether they would be likely to join our Standard, etc. Say to 
Gten'l Lamar I hope he is quite recov'd. tee ought to mount his 
Horse and go the Mountains, or reside on the front beach at Gal- 
veston. The " City " is very little better than Houston, and will 
have Yellow Fever, unless they have a good police. You can gen^

My dear Sir, 

This will be presented you by Mr Treat of New York — a Gentle- 
man intimately acquainted with Mexico and Mexican Politics — 
hav'g passed much of his time there and enjoyed the confidence of 
the leading men of the country. Genl Hamilton, evidently under 
the advice of Mr Poinsett — thinks very much can be accomplished by 
Mr Treats personal presence in Mexico, in which I entirely concur. 
Mr. Treat has had frequent interviews with the Secret Agent here 
and is armed at all points. He will explain his views fuUy to the 
President. The question will arise as to Mr. Treats immediate ac- 
tion. Should he receive favorable news by the Constitution his visit 
may be imnecessary. Should they however be playing off — as is 
more than probable until their Agent reports — ^then the sooner Mr. 
Treat is in the City of Mexico the better. 

Permit me to requ^ you will introduce Mr Treat to the Presid't. 
I recommend him to your particular kindness. 
I am very Sincerely 
Yours

[July (?),1839.] 
My dear Sir, 

I am very much in hopes the first news from Mexico will render 
Mr. Treats visit to that Country wholly innecessary. Should it prove 
otherwise however — and they are disposed to play off, until they nave 
assurance that we have money to carry us through — ^there can be no 
one more adequate than Mr Treat. The Secret Agent here seems a 
man much to be relied on, and I ascertained at Vera Cruz (of course 
without my object being known) that he had been liv'g many years 
in Mexico, with an unblemished character. I learn with great regret 
that the Zavala has been sold.^ We will repent it if Mexico does 
not listen to us. The Zavala would have been able to have put their 
whole Coast in the utmost excitement and have been almost ubiqui- 
tous — carrying hundreds of men on board and making incursions any 
where — ^but it is done, and we hope for Peace. I am very much 
gratified that the President has drawn Mr Burnet around him. it 
silences the Telegraph effectually, and evinces harmony in the Dept's 
so essential to a Gov't.^ I was delighted with your letter relative to 
the Live Oak Custom House. They will soon cease their nonsense. 
I told them before I came away if Gen'l Lamar did wrong they might 
abuse him as much as they pleased, but they had better reserve them- 
selves for the fact. The Cherokee talk was excellent. Was that 
yours or Mr. Burnetts — or both ? * It will make Genl Sam outrageous. 
I learn you have a highly respectable man as Secy of the Treasury.^ 
it is a most important office requir'g to be strictly looked into and most 
judiciously managed for the future, without the Presidents in- 
terfering with the Departm'ts he ought to know ev'y important trans- 
action, and I am satisfied by pursuing this course he will save tens of 
Thousands — ^particularly, in the War and Navy Departments. You 
will perceive that Santa Anna has retired to Manga de Clavo.^ 

Bravo is entirely under his Control. This move is wholly in rela- 
tion to Texas. Peace or War will be the result. Santa Anna was

Hamilton to Lamab.« 

New York August 1st. 1839. 
My Dear Sir 

I have but a moment to spare before embarking this morning in 
the Great Western to drop you a line, to say I have left instructions 
for my son's dispatches to be forwarded by the next Steamer. I 
hope sincerely that you have assented to the sinking fimd project, 
and the other matters submitted for your consideration, as I deem 
them vital to my success. I have lost nothing by staying, as I will 
be over as soon as Saligny, who went about ten days since in a 
French (Corvette) and such is the state of the money market in 
England, that before October I will not be able to do anything. 
After that I hope to obtain another handsome advance on my bonds, 
or to place them in final investment. I feel confident of success. 
But for the official dispatch of the Secretary of War, asking the 
means for invading Texas, I would have obtained through my 
friends at Washington such demonstrations of a pacific character 
from Martinez, as would have greatly aided my negotiation.* Just 
as I had it on the anvil this unfortunate document came out. I 
think from what Mr. Poinsett tells me, you must be prepared for 
an incursion on the part of the Mexicans and Indians. The former 
will make one more struggle before they give up the country. Let 
me intreat you, neither to invade or blockade until you hear from me, 
that I have succeeded in my loan — either measure would be fatal to 
my efforts. I have authorized Mr. Todd,*' your Navy Agent, to draw 
on me in London for 10.000$ to ship by every Vessel from London 
(which I hope will meet your approbation) After consulting with 
an English Naval officer of distinguished reputation, and of great 
experience on the Coast of Mexico, I will give you the details of a 
maratime expedition against Mexico, which will strike terror in 
that Government bring them to their senses, and astonish the world, 
by its boldness and success. I have been concocting this Scheme fcH*

Department or State 

Houston 9th August 1839. 
Sir, 

I am instructed by the President, to inform you that in conformity 
with our late verbal understanding you are hereby constituted and 
appointed a Private and Confidential Agent for the Grovemment of 
Texas for the purpose of ascertaining the disposition of the Gov- 
ernment of Mexico in regard to a negotiation of a perfce between the 
two Nations and if practicable to prepare the initiatory arrangements 
for such a negotiation. 

To effect this object, it will be necessary for you to repair with all 
convenient expedition to the city of Mexico. But as great privacy 
and circumspection are necessary and indispensable in all your pre- 
paratory movements, it will perhaps be advisable for you to return as 
far as Pensacola or even to New York and embark for Vera Cruz 
from one of those Ports. 

It is inevitable to the nature of your mission that great latitude 
should be given to the exercise of your own discretion in the modtis 
operandi^ and in some minor matters of the negotiation. The Presi- 
dent is happy in the confidence that, that discretion will in all cases, 
be exercised with great soundness and intelligence, and with an 
undeviating regard to the interests and the honor of Texas: that you 
will not sacrifice the one, nor compromit the other. There are other 
points of cardinal importance, on which you will rigidly adhere to 
your instructions. Texas is sincerely desirous of peace, but that 
desire does not result from any apprehension of her want of ability 
to prosecute a vigerous and successful war. The moment she ascer- 
tains that this second overture is rejected, she will feel it due to her- 
self, to try the efficacy of the utmost energies of the sword, in accom- 
plishing that desirable object; and she cannot doubt that it will be 
eventually effected at a less cost of treasure, than she is now willing 
to bestow in peaceable negotiation, and that the incidental expendi- 
ture of blood, will be richly compensated in her acquisitions of glory. 

The principal points in your negotiations will be; The boundary 
to be assigned to Texas; and the consideration to be paid for that 
boundary.

COEBESPON0ENCE WITH MEXICO. 471 

A full, unequivocal, unconditional acknowledgment of the abso- 
lute independence of Texas, is a sine qua non, beyond and exclusive 
of which, you will not discuss a single proposition. 

The Rio Grande alias tiie Rio Bravo del Norte is the natural 
boundary of Texas; it presents an obvious and well defined line of 
demarcation and is admirably adapted to the prevention of future 
collision between the two Governments. You will therefore consider 
it a sine qua non in your negotiation, that the boundary line shall 
commence at the mouth of the Rio Grande midway of the channel, 
and shall pursue the mid channel of that stream to its source, that is 
to the fountain head of its principal western branch and to run from 
that point a due north course to the line of the United States as 
established in the treaty of limits between the United States and 
Mexico on the day of * and to pursue that line to the 

Pacific Ocean. This boundary and nothing short of it Texas is will- 
ing to accede to. 

Before submitting this ultimatum on the subject of a boundary 
line, you will feel the authorities of Mexico in relation to a different 
division of Territory. You may suggest to them a line conmiencing 
at the mouth of the Rio Grande mid way of its channel, up that 
stream to the Paso del Norte and from thence a due west line to the 
Gulf of Calafornia and along the Southern shore of that Gulf to the 
Pacific Ocean. This boundary will not be strenuously insisted upon 
but may be intimated as a counterpoise to any extravagant expecta- 
tions on the part of Mexico and as a premonition to that Government 
of the ultimate destination of that remote Territory. 

Texas is willing to pay to Mexico a sum not exceeding Five Mil- 
lions of dollars as a compensation for her relinquishment of all her 
claims public and private to the Territory comprehended within the 
limits first above recited, but you are desired to employ all your 
means to reduce that Maximimi sum as much as possible. We con- 
sider Three Millions of dollars an adequate remuneration under the 
circiunstances, and we proffer the extra two millions as an evidence of 
our appreciation of the mutual benefits that must result from the 
restoration of peace, and an intercourse between the two Nations. 
You will carefully abstain from agreeing to fumidi any given 
amount of Mexican Bonds in the English market until it is clearly 
ascertained that those bonds can be purchased at or under the value 
you may put upon them in making up the aggregate of the con- 
sideration, as we are not disposed to incur any hazard incident to 
the stock markets of Great Britain. 

Should you therefore find it expedient to swell the nominal amount 
of the consideration, by agreeing to pay a proportion of it in Mexi- 
can Bonds, it will not be difficult, as the value of those bonds in the

market is well known in Mexico, to stipulate for such a sum founded 
on the known depreciation of those Bonds, as will assure to Texas no 
increased expenditure from this branch of the negotiation. In order 
to your more perfect advisement in this matter it will be proper for 
you to have early and frequent communications with GrenL Hamilton 
and Mr. Burnley our Loan Commissioners in London. 

If it shall in your estimation become necessary to employ any 
considerable amount of funds as secret service money to forward 
your operations, you may exercise your own good discretion, but 
always bearing in mind that Five Millions of dollars is the utmost 
extent to which Texas is willing to become liable and that any 
monies so appropriated, must be abated from that sum, and in no 
wise constitute a separate charge. Should it however become neces- 
sary for you to employ the secret service of particular agents in this 
affair, you will do so to an extent not exceeding one thousand dollars, 
for which this Government will be responsible to you. You will 
recollect in all cases that we rely with great confidence upon your 
discretion and good judgment. 

I submit to you for your further government a copy of the in- 
structions given to the Honl B. E. Bee« on his late mission to Mexico 
in prosecution of a similar object to that you have in view. 

Col Bee will be informed of your Mission and you are at liberty 
to communicate to him your progress from time to time, but in all 
events you will keep this Department regularly and fully informed 
of your proceedings. 

With great consideration, 

I am Your obdt Servant

Agerd was on his way to New Orleans when I met him at Vera Cruz. 
His object was to have prevented my applying directly to the Gov't, 
least it should be rejected. I declined all communication then, as 1 
had already addressed the Secy of State. Moreover I look upon 
the negotiation as now going on, Mr Packenham writes we have 
only to have a little patience. I have very little doubt letters are 
now at Washington on the subject. I shall proceed there the moment 
I hear from Mr Poinsett. It will never do to let it wear the appear- 
ance of a second appeal. The Senate might give us trouble. I shall 
take the liberty of alter'g your instructions — in so much. 

I shall proceed immediately to Pendleton. Pray let me hear from 
you. Remember me to the President, and say to him if he and his 
Secy of the Treasury do not create a demand for their money it wUl 
be down to 15 cents. I propose that Fifty Thous'd Dollars of the 
Post Notes should be put in the hands of Mr Jacob Barker — upon 
his deposit'g treble the amt in Texas Tnoney in the Merchants Bank, 
as one means of keeping up the currency, another mode is to make 
an arrangement with the Steam Boat Columbia to take Your Money 
at 50 or 70 cents for passage and freight and your redeem'g it ev'y 
fortnight in good money. By either or both of these modes there 
would be a vitality — so to say — ^given to your Money which would 
soon make it sustain itself. Without some effort on the part of the 
Gov't, it cannot be upheld. Another mode is to put the Zavala in 
the Trade as a Mail Packet, taking passengers and freight ai pa/r. 
You would of course lose Money at first, but it will be more tiian 
compensated to you in the enhanced value of the currency thus bene- 
fitting the whole Country. 

I am no financier, but it is important something should De done. 
I have consulted the owners of the Steam Boat They are willing 
to make the arrangement. They would submit their Books ev'y trip 
to the inspection of the Consul. I have also conversed witii Mr 
Barker, who is will'g to pledge three for one and thus give your 
money a chance in the market. Pray converse with Dr. Starr on the 
subject. If we could disperse the Mexicans as easily as you have- 
the Cherokees I would be for fighting instead of negotiating. I con- 
gratulate you on the result. 
I am My dear Sir, 

With great regard 
and esteem

indispensable. It would be weakness not to make one.

New Orleans 12th Augt. 1839 
Col. Bee ^ 

Dear Sir 

You ask me to point out the best way to prevent a depreciation of 
Texas paper. I answer let your Government make it as current at 
home as possible and place here in the Merchants Bank an adequate 
sum of money to protect it here. I think $100,000 would be sufficient 
perhaps $50,000 would answer and my House Messrs. Horace Bean 
& Co would undertake its management. Let your Gk)vemment 
direct the Bank to receive in exchange tor this fund from my House 
their money at such rate as they might judge best. Three dollars 
for one to b^in with would probably be best, and to exchange back 
again one for three as often as my house applied not less than 
$10,000 at a time thus keeping possession of the whole fimd. The 
Bank would gladly do this for the sake of the deposite and my house 
would always take the money from travellers and traders when it 
offered at 33 cts on the dollar and supply those who might want at 
34 cts on a dollar making no charge for these services, from this the 
standard to be gradually advanced as the demand increased always 
purchasing within one cent on the dollar on their selling price; to 
prevent the fund being exhausted without effecting the object, the 
system must be ccwnmenced at the lowest market price, perhaps below 
three for one, when the standard could be advanced as the market 
price improved ; if the management was entrusted to my house they 
would pledge themselves never to speculate on the funds and to make 
it effectual the management must be kept a profound secret from all 
others and the Bank should not know any thing beyond the fact 
that they were to pay and receive according to the rule layed down 
by your Government and that rule not to be varied except by an order 
from your Gk)vemment. 

One other provision would greatly improve the value of the money 
which would be to pass a law authorizing the issuing of funded stock 
for the money when brought home to be funded irredeamable for 60 
years bearing an interest of 6 per cent per Annum payable half 
yearly in specie and pledging some particular branch of revenue for 
the payment of the interest, for instance the auction duty which 
could be made sufficient. 
Very Respectfully

New ORLEANS Augt 13th 1839. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your official letter 
of instructions, bearing date, Houston 9th Inst, informing me of the 
wishes of the President of the Republic, and apprising me of the 
confidence reposed by His Excellency in my prudence and judgement, 
for the Execution of a delicate and important object, to the fulfilment 
of which, my most earnest efforts, shall be, exclusively devoted. 

My hurried departure from Galveston prevented me from address- 
ing you this communication (as would have been very proper) at 
that time. 

I have further to own receipt of two letters of credit, signed by 
His Excelly. the President, bearing the same date, amounting, to- 
gether, to the sum of Twelve Hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling^ 
(Say 1250) ) which I am authorized to negotiate, as directed by Gen 
Hamilton, in a communication, which I have shewn to his Excellency 
the President and yourself. 

In looking over my instructions, I find omitted a clause which (if 
I remember right) was, in the original Dft, and as I then thought, 
very properly inserted. 

It related to the Mediation of the U. S., and authorized me, to 
confer, or advise, (as might seem expedient) with Judge Ellis, the 
American Minister, near Mexo. 

If this, was inadvertently omitted, (as I apprehend it was, from 
the' Press of business on hand) I most respectfully suggest that it 
may may be embraced in your first, official Letter to me, so that I may 
consider it as a part (part) of my instructions. 

I shall also be indebted to the department, for any new suggestions, 
that may result from deliberation, or fresh information, from any 
quarter. 

Feeling duly the responsibility of the Trust I have assumed, I 
shall use every honourable effort to carry out the views of the Presi- 
dent; but, whether successful or not, I shall hope to merit the appro- 
bation of his Excellency the President and his constitutional advisers. 

Please place this communication, (Hurried as it is, for I write on 
board the Boat altho dated at N Orleans) with my Respects before 
the President, to whom I do not write on the present occasion, having 
nothing, beyond the contents of this note, to communicate.

Sir 

The instructions hastily communicated to you on the 9th instant 
were deficient, and I hasten to impart to you the additional wishes of 
the President in relation to your interesting mission.* 

Should you receive a favorable notice in Mexico and be able to 
progress so far as to establish a boundary line and the amount of 
compensation, you may stipulate that a treaty of peace, amity and 
commerce between the two nations shall be entered upon, as soon as 
practicable either at the city of Mexico, or the City of Washington 
or at the Capitol of this Republic, leaving it to the Mexican Author- 
ities to select the location. 

But as the mediatorial interposition of the Government of the 
United States has been conditionally proffered and will be cordially 
accepted by this Government it would probably be conducive to the 
permanency of the peace to be established, to conduct the negotiation 
at the Capitol of that Republic 

It is understood that Mr Ellis the Minister from the Government 
of the United States to that of Mexico, has been instructed to signify 
to that of Mexico the desire of the United States to see the difficulties 
between Texas and Mexico amicably adjusted. 

You will therefore feel yourself at liberty with all appropriate 
delecacy, to confer with Mr Ellis and to make known to him pri- 
vately, the nature and progress of your negotiation. 

•There is filed in the Correspondence with Mexico an undated memorandum of in- 
structions to Treat in which are found the following points, not covered by letters to 
Bee and to Treat: 

** . . . . Mr. T. will proceed to N. Orleans, and thence to Mexico either direct, or Via

My dear General. 

■ Pursuant to your own request, that I should communicate to you 
pri/vatelyy and frequently^ I have now the pleasure, as well as gratifi- 
cation, to address you, for the first time, since I took my leave. 

From N. Orleans, I addressd two official letters to the acting Secy 
of StatCj and also a private or friendly communication, containing 
such news as I found contained in my letters from Europe and from 
Mexico.* 

I requested Judge Burnet to shew you these communications, which 
I have no doubt Vas done without any delay whatever. 

I have now addressed, a lengthy official Letter to the Hon. Secretary 
of State^ which contains all the information, or remarks, which I 
thought could be useful, or gratifying to yourself, as well as your 
constitutional advisers. May I venture. General, to refer you to that 
communication for the information (should it prove to be so) that it 
may contain. I would give it in copy, had I time before Post, but 
fear I may miss the Columbia If I delay a day longer. 

I have reported myself up to the present time, and informed the 
Department of my intended movements, that I had been disappointed 
in my certain expectations of obtaining money from the Bank of the 
U States on my bill against your Loan Commissioners ; and in con-

sequence of said disappointment^ I have solicited the Secy of State to 
ask of you to place the sum of four Thousamd DoUars^ out of the Post 
Note fund at my disposal for the necessary expenses. These matters 
and some other topics are all treated at length, in said communication, 
to which I again Respectfully crave your attention. I have address'd 
Judge Burnet a separate and Private Letter in case the State Depart- 
ment should be in new hands, who might be without any knowledge 
of the antecedents of this negotiation. 

I trust my dear General, you will not find my request unreasonable, 
as of course means are necessary to carry out your views. I con- 
gratulate you, Sir, on the flattering prospects of an immediate recog- 
nition by France ; on the favourable influence tJiai measure will have 
on the British Cabinet; and as regards the negotiations of your Com- 
missioners in Europe; and last thd* not least on the effect it will, nay, 
Twast have on the minds of the Statesmen of Mexico, who must of 
course see the utter uaelessnesa of delaying a friendly arrangement of 
Difficulties, before it is too late, 

I anticipate. Gen Success in my mission^ and for you Sir, before you 
leave the chair, that Your country will be recognized by France, 
England, and also by the Mother Country .« Your country will then 
stand, on a pre-eminence, at once proud, and enviable. Pardon the

New York September 3d. 1839. 
Sir 

I beg leave to refer you to the official letter I had the honor to 
address you from New Orleans under date 13th Ulto; and also to 
another communication returning a paper inadvertently inclosed 
among my own in the hurry of my dispatch. 

In a private communication of same date I informed you of the 
then recent news from England and Mexico. 

I have now the honor further to inform you, for the information 
of the President, that I left New Orleans on the 15th Ulto., and pro- 
ceeded to Pensacola where I found the American Squadron all laid

COBBBSPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 479 

up unta the 1st Octr. next. I left without an hour's delay and 
arrived at Philadelphia after some detention on the road on the 
27th. Ulto., where I was detained two days to see the President of 
the United States Bank of Pennsylvania in order to negotiate my 
Bill on the Commissioners for £750, in conformity with the authoriza- 
tion of the President and your own directions. 

From the extreme pressure for money here and in England, I 
feared the President of the Bank might not meet Qenl, Hamilton's 
views, amd I therefore assured him in making the application that 
Ihe objects to be accomplished and for which those means were 
appropriated, were highly important to the Government of Texas, 
as well as of great interest to the prospects of the Commissioners in 
England ; but these assurances, as it seems, did not avail, as you see 
by his reply to me in the following words: 

" Your communication has received the most respectful considera- 
" tion, but I regret fo say that with every disposition to do what might 
" be agreeable or useful to you and those you represent, the present 
" state of the money market here and abroad compels this institution 
" very reluctantly to decline the purchase of your Bill." 

On receiving a negative I was of opinion that had I explained 
fully and in extenso to the President the objects of my mission, and 
he again to the Exchange Committee, I would nevertheless have 
succeeded. But a moment's reflection convinced me that I could not 
with propriety enter into full explanations which would develope 
the views and policy of your Government, without the exercise of 
too much discretion on my part; and furthermore I did not think it 
good policy thus to disclose the position of your affairs, even had I 
the authority to do so. I rather preferred adopting some other 
expedient to raise funds, and keep the objects entrusted to me to 
myself. 

I found it impracticable to negotiate my Bills on your Loan Com- 
missioners any where, and concluded to forward them for collection 
by the packets of 1st. inst. for acceptance and payment, and then I 
can of course command the amount without exposing the secret plans 
of the Government as regards Mexico. 

Meanwhile Sir, I am and shall be without any measns to execute the 
Presidents instructions and carry out the views of your Government 
until I hear from my said Bill. I therefore respectfully submit to' 
you, and through you to the President, whether he will not direct to 
be placed in New Orleans, and subject to my order, say Four thousand 
Dollars^ out of the Post note fund, to be used by me for my necessary 
expenses if my other resources fail me, and until I can be placed in 
funds through your Loan Commissioners, as contemplated by Genl. 
Hamilton and confirmed by the President and yourself. It will be 
admitted by all that means are indispensable, and that, since my

movements should not be suspended or retarded for want of mcmey 
to defray the exp^ises of the Mission entrusted to me by your Gov- 
ernment, it would seem but just and proper that the President should, 
if he deems the request a reasonable one, assent to it and direct that 
this be done by the first Steamer. I would respectfully further sug- 
gest in case this request is granted, that the money be placed in the 
hands of Doct. James Ritchie of New Orleans to deliver to me or my 
order when called for, which will only be in the event of necessity, 
and then only to such an extent as may be necessary and in conformity 
with my instructions. Col. James Love may be referred to for in- 
formation of Doct. Ritchie, and I name him because it is the channel 
through which all my correspondence passes to and from the Gov- 
ernment of Texas. 

I arrived here on the 29th inst., and have availed of the London 
and Liverpool packets to communicate with the Loan Commissioners 
very fully and at length in regard to all matters which may interest 
them. I have also communicated with your Representative at Wash- 
ington, Genl. Dunlap, and shall receive his hearty cooperation in 
every thing I may desire in this quarter. 

Genl. Henderson (now supposed to be in London) has been kept 
advised of every matter of importance which has transpired in 
Mexico and the United States, and to him I have also written fully 
on yesterday. 

On the 8th inst we shall look for the Great Western, and before 
that I hope to receive dispatches from your Department. A vessel 
is also expected here shortly from Vera Cruz, and I will then obtain 
from Washington the latest information from Mr. Ellis, secure the 
further good offices of the Govt, of the United States if neces- 
sary in behalf of Texas, and embark for Vera Cruz either from this 
port, or proceed to Pensacola, where about the 1st proxo. or before 
the fleet will be in motion, I can obtain conveyance which is already 
arranged with Come. Shubrick thro' letters from Col. Bee, to whom 
I write this day addr^sed at Pendleton Sth Carolina. 

You will be apprized of the recent changes in Mexico before this 
reaches you. I need only observe that Bustamente's return to power 
will not, as I believe operate against my objects; and the change of 
Ministry I think advantageous to the country as they are taken from 
among the liberal party and are men of talent. Gorostiza is succeeded 
by Juan De Dios Caiiedo as Secy of State, who is an old and intimate 
acquaintance of mine. Cuevas the Secy of the Interior is also a 
man of liberal and enlarged views; and Bustamente, with such ad- 
visers aroimd him, and other influences which I shall, I trust, be able 
to bring to bear on the question, will I have little doubt be disposed 
to listen to the dictates of reason, rather than hazard the alternative. 
At all events, as I informed the President as well as yourself

COBRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 481 

veriaUi/y it will be something to ascertain what they may be disposed 
to do in the way of conciliation^ or what they v)iU not do. And this 
information I trust I shall be able to acquire as soon as practicjable, 
and I have little doubt of a successful result My best efforts shall 
not be wanting to this end. 

The favorable information from Genl. Henderson in relation to his 
progress towards the obtainment of a recognition by France you will 
also have received ere this reaches you. There can be no doubt judg- 
ing from my advices, but the measure had been decided upon by the 
King and Council, and I should not be surprised if the o^iciaZ act 
reached here by the Steamer G. Western expected in about a week. 
This fact of recognition by France will no doubt produce a favorable 
effect on Genl. Hamilton's object as regards the Loan, and will 
further and more especially, as I shall use it^ operate as a strong 
inducement for Mexico not to forego the present (and no doubt the 
only) opportunity it may ever have of a friendly arrangement with 
Texas. 

I therefore think my chances of success are much strengthened by 
this event, as well as other circumstances. 

In reference to Grenl. Hamilton's probable success, I will take the 
liberty to remark that I have some hopes that he may make some par- 
tial progress in the sale of the Bonds, notwithstanding the unprece- 
dented sad state of the monetary concerns of England. All however 
depends on the next advices from England. If the Corn crop should 
prove a fair medium one, or something better than usual, all will be 
comparatively well. If it is shorty it is difficult to foresee what the 
consequences may be. The suspension of payments in Specie by the 
Bank of England ; or if not, an utter inability to render any aid to 
the community at large, as it will require all her means (altho* 
immense) to sustain herself and the Govemmt. The bankrupcy of 
one half of Great Britain might be the consequence of a failure of the 
crops. The next arrival therefore involves matters of greater interest 
to G. Britain and the United States, (indeed to the whole world) 
than were ever narrowed into the compass of one steamer. I shall 
not fail to apprise you of the news brought by the G. Western by 
first post after her arrival here and trust and hope they may be 
favorable. 

I have extended my communication far beyond what I intended, 
and must claim your indulgence for having done so, and also for 
having travelled out of my appropriate sphere in treating of matters 
not properly committed to my management. You will I trust con- 
sider that this arises only from a desire to make myself useful, so 
far as my position will enable me to do so. 

Should you not deem my communication too lengthy will you do 
me the favor to place it before the President.

Permit me Sir before closing, respectfully to call your attention 
and that of the President to that part of this communication which 
refers to furnishing me with money for purposes already explained 
and understood. I would further suggest with due respect that 
duplicate answers be sent to Dr. Ritchie, with directions for one to 
be sent to me here (to be used by my agent in my absence), and the 
other to be disposed of according to any directions to him.

Via N. Orleans, j 

New York September 10th. 1839. 
Sir, 

I last, had this pleasure under date of 3d inst, which, I doubt not, 
will be in ample time for the Columbia, to sail on the 15th. inst from 
N. Orleans, and I hope it will reach you, on the 19tti or 20th of the 
present Mo. 

In that communication, I gave you, for the information of the 
President, all the information, general and particular^ that I thought 
would be acceptable, imder existing circumstances. 

I only hope, that neither the President nor Yourself will censure 
me for the latitude^ I have ventured to take in my advices. 

The principal object of this communication is to announce to you 
the arrival of the Westem^^ Steamer Packet of the 24th ulto, (referrd 
to in my last despatch) and which is now coming up the Bay. I 
trust her letters will be delivered from the Post office, by 1 or 2 P M.

and that I shall be enabled to give you the general features of the 
news, at least by to days post. 

I therefore prepare this letter, so far^ and will add what I can learn 
to the closing of the mail. 12 oClk Since writing the foregoing and 
while waiting for my letters I have received advices pr Packet Ship 
l-iouisa, direct from V. Cruz, from the city to 10. and from the Coast 
to the 15th Ulto. So far as ray letters go, there is nothing of any 
moment, Except that Bustamente's new Cabinet had been completed, 
by the appointment of Col. {now General) Almonte as Minister of 
War, which I am inclined to look upon as a favourable circumstance 
to an amicable arrangement with' your Govmt Almonte, is shrewd, 
observing, and intelligent, and well knows what the true interests of 
his own Country requires, and having been much abroad, speaking all 
the languages, etc and more especially having been in the former 
Campaign^ will be entitled to consideration, wJien the time for the dis- 
cussion arrives. I shall Examine the papers, (having received ample 
files) and if I find any thing of moment will apprise you. Meantime 
I abstain from filling up any more of my space, until I get my Letters 
pr the Western. 

Septr. 11th. I was compelld to suspend my communication, as I 
did not receive any letters Either from Messrs Hamilton or Burnley, 
or from Gren Henderson, which I thought singular, until I found that 
a letter from Gen H. to a commercial House here referrd. to letters 
sent hy or m, the Bag of the Legation of the U S. in London. I have 
sought in vain for them, and altho' I am persuaded that such letters 
as are referrd. to by Gen H. (and among them one probably for me) 
were either placed in the Bag, or intended to be. If the former they 
have probably gone to Wash[ingto]n. If they have not come over, 
they will reach here in the Queen, to sail 3d inst Expected 19th 
or 20th. 

Whether the despatches from Gen. Hamilton or Gren. Henderson 
for your Govmt. are in the same predicament, I have no means of 
knowing. The Gen News, pr G. Western, may be summed up thus — 
The com crops in the south of England and Midland counties would 
be good, and the prospects of the North and Scotland fair. The 
Queen would bring them.<» . It was thought there would be an average 
crop. The Money Market was about in the same position. The 
Illinois Agents had negotiated four millions, but it was connected 
with a contract for Iron, and the terms or conditions had not tran- 
spired. The question of Recognition by France, had not progressd. 
since the preceding dates. It would soon take place no doubt Gren. 
Hamilton, I hear wrote in good spirits — ^would leave for Paris 24th

Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your official com- 
munication of 19th Augt., duly at hand, which is intended (and will 
so be considered by me) as an addition to the instructions^ which 
I received personally from your hands, under date of 9th. of same 
month. 

These additional instructions are, in my opinion, important, (as 
you will see by my respects of 13th Augt. not then received by you) 
and I shall endeavour so to make use of them as to secure, to the 
greatest possible extent, the advantages contemplated by the Presi-

regret the unexpected absence of my oum advices from the Loan

from various circumstances, that I should have received letters from 
both the above sources, but as I have every reason to believe they 
missed the Steamer on the otfier side from some accident, which 
will be explained by the British Queen, expected in one or two days.

the commissioners every opp[ortunity], and in duplicate, and have 
left them to inform Gen Henderson of the objects contemplated by 
my private mission; as this would seem proper, if not necessary. 

The rumors, here, are that Gren. Henderson had made no further 
progress, since the former advices, towards recognition by France 
(probably owing to the King and Cabinet being constantly occupied 
with the affairs of the East) Thdsj I believe is founded in fact. It is 
further stated that Gen. Hamilton found a warm and flattering re- 
ception — tfiatj altho' the pressure was very great, yet he thought a 
favourable turn near at hand, — Tfuzt he hoped for partial success, 
when affairs should assume a better aspect and tha^ he felt Confident 
that the Recognition of France, and also of England^ would be soon 
obtained. This would all seem quite probablCj and therefore may be 
true, yet I only mention them as rumours here. Gen Hamilton would 
leave London for Paris on the 24th. August. 

We shall so soon have the advices pr Queen, that I abstain from any 
further comment, which, at best, would be nothing but conjecture^ on 
my part. I only await the arrival of the Steamer, and, meantime, 
also, to have an interview with a friend of mine in the Cabinet of this 
Govmt. (necessarily deferrd, by unavoidable circumstances) and shall 
then be prepared to leave, of which, and Route, I will duly advise 
your Department. 

I enclose a private letter to Gen Lamar, which I beg you will hand

[Private and Confidential.] 

New York, September 18th 1839. 
My dear Sir. 

I have the honor and the satisfaction, to lay before you my own 
translations of two papers, which I have recently received, and 
which I think you will consider as favourable to the accomplishment 
of some of the objects embraced in my mission. 

No 1. is an exact, and full translation of a brief note from our 
private friend in Mexico to my friend and co-operator then at New 
Orleans, and will speak for itself. 

No 2. is a translation of the remarks of my friend in N. Orleans, 
who encloses it, and who, like myself, thinks the change decidedly 
favourable. 

My friend would embark from N. Orleans about 15th inst for 
Tampico, not a single vessel having sailed from N. O. for Vera Cruz, 
or Tampico since my departure from that city on the 15th. ulto.; 
hence his delay. He will be in the City of Mexico about the 1st or 
5th October. If I leave here, as I intend to do, by the 25th, instant, 
I shall not be more than 10 days behind him. I feel confident that 
it will not require much time, before I shall be able to ascertain 
whether this disposition to enter upon Some reasonable and amicable 
arrangement is real or apparent. I beg leave to refer you to my pre- 
vious private Respects, and hereafter, I trust, I shall have more fre- 
quent occasion to address you, when I hope my advices will possess 
more interest. 

I also take leave to refer you to my several communications to the

you have not, I will give them.

I know them all very well. They are moderate as party men, very 
talented, and further^ are men of great probity of character; quite 
rare occurrence in that Country. 

I consider this change favourable to our object, because these men 
are all highly intelligent, and of great integrity, hence, it will be 
easier to convince them of the true position of the Texas Question, 
and <dso^ because it will not be necessary to use so large an amount

Sir— 

I last had this pleasure on the 18th and 19th inst. to which I 
crave reference, and have now the pleasure to announce the arrival 
of the British Queen Steamer, with dates from London to the 2d 
instant. 

This packet arrived yesterday noon, but too late for me to obtain 
her news for yesterday's post. I am sorry to say I have nothing 
direct from either of the Commissioners myself, unless a gentleman 
who came over, and brought some letters from Genl. Hamilton to 
others, should have some for me also. I have not yet been able to 
find him, tho' I fear, when I do, I shall not be gratified by any 
communications. I cannot however omit stating generally what I 
have heard, and presume to be correct, and especially as I know 
not if you will receive dispatches either from Genl. Henderson or 
Genl. Hamilton by this packet; 

It appears that Genl. Hamilton went to Paris 24th Augt. and 
writes from thence as late as the 31st same month. He had seen

Marshal Soult, and had a most gratifying interview with him. 
Genl. Henderson had nearly c<Mnpleted his treaty, which of course 
had for basis the Recognition of Texas. It was thought he might 
bring it hdmself in the Liverpool Stecmier to sail this day, Genl. 
Hamilton would also return here pr. the same Vessel whether (lenl. 
Henderson came or not. A formal offer of your Bonds would not 
probably be made to the public while the market was so extremely 
depressd. as it continued to be. But between October and January 
next, it was believed the Loan might be effected. Meanwhile some 
money might be had in advance of the negotiation. When the Treaty 
should be finished with France, there would be some time to feel 
of the British Govemmt. as regards their views in relation to recog- 
nition, and it was thought that they would not long hesitate in their 
decision, which it was believed would be favorable. O'Connell's 
effort to hamper the Ministers would come too late — ^at least that was 
the impression. 

This Sir, is the substance of the information which I have obtained 
from letters from London and Paris, and I think it entitled to 
general credence. I however give it to you as I reed, it, and trust 
the President will receive it as all / can tww impart to him on these 
interesting topics. 

If you receive as I hope you will your regular advices from the 
right quarters, you will learn the facts from a hetter source. If not, 
then even this may be gratifying to the President and his advisers. 

The news generally is unfavorable, and the shipment of One Mil- 
lions more of specie pr G. Western which sails to day makes things 
look very squally here. The Crops however in England were coming 
in thAis far very favorably. Affairs in the East had not yet been 
satisfactorily settled, but they were or will be under the direction of 
the five Great Powers, who will doubtless preserve the peace of 
Europe. You will see by the papers I send you the Queen's speech 
at the closing of Parliament. Also an article from the Albion of to 
day, which I have not yet seen, hut am told is a very judicious one. 

I beg you to lay this communication before the President with 
my respectful considerations. 
I remain Sir 

with great regard

Treat to Burnet.** 

Via New Orleans — 

New York October 5th 1839. 
Sir 

My last respects were under date of 18th. and 21st. Ulto., to which 
I beg reference, altho' neither of them were important. Since then 
we have no further news from Mexico, nor from Europe. The 
Steamer Liverpool, to leave 21st Ulto., will be due about 8th inst, 
and I anticipate some flattering intelligence for your Country by her, 
of which I will immediately advise you. 

I had thought when 1 last had this pleasure, that my next com- 
munication would advise you of my im/inediate^ if not actual depar- 
ture, but there exist some causes of delay which I have thought justi- 
fiable, and I hasten to apprize the President through your Depart- 
ment what they are, trusting that he will approve the motives which 
may induce the little delay referred to, and even the delay itself. 
The ship Ann Louisa which it is was thought would get away on or 
about the 25th. Ulto. will sail on the 6th. inst for Vera Cruz, being the 
first Vessel from this port (or any neighbouring port) for Mexico 
since my arrival here, and by this Vessel I had intended going, and 
personally am now ready and desirous to embark. 

But 1st., I have not heard of my friend's actual embarcation from 
N. Orleans, who, according to the plan we laid down, was to precede 
me, and tho' this was not deemed indispensable, yet it was thought 
expedient. This delay on his part arises no doubt from the deten- 
tion of the only Vessel which could convey him, viz. the Schr Doric 
for Tampico, there having been no other Vessel for any part in 
Mexico since 15th. Augt. Either this, or his indisposition (I have 
no doubt the former) must be the cause of his unexpected and un- 
wished for delay, and I am left in doubt, in the absence of his letters, 
whichj from his usual punctuality I fear have miscarried. 

2nd. I thought I was so near the expected arrival of the Steamer 
Liverpool which would bring Genl. Henderson and his Treaty with 
France (as is now believed by all) that I should be justified in wait- 
ing for them a few days, as the official knowledge of the Recognition 
by France would be an item for an argument which would be very 
available, and an interview with Genl. Hamilton would be highly 
desirable on my part, and the more so, as he will have left Europe 
before any of my communications to him will have arrived there, and 
further by confering with him I might obtain some information of 
the Mexican Bond mafket^ which would be useful to me at the very 
commencement of my discussions.

And 3d. Genl. Dunlap has thought it important that he should see 
Mr. Forsyth or the President, and induce some further communica- 
tions from the former to Mr. Ellis the American Envoy in Mexico, 
which might be useful generally and particularly^ in case the media- 
tion of the U. States should be asked for by Mexico. And this he 
has not yet been able to obtain, owing to the absence of the Presi- 
dent and most of the Cabinet until now^ when they are again reas- 
sembling at Washington and where Genl Dunlap only arrived him- 
self about three days since; and from whom I expect advices, and if 
necessary I will myself repair to Washington, which is very probable, 
but #iily for a few hours or a day at farthest. 

For these various considerations I am induced to omit going in 
the Vessel of the 6th., as I intended, but there are two other Vessels 
to succeed for the same port and [they] will sail from the 12th. to 
15th. inst., in either of which I can take passage, and thus only lose, 
as it were^ some week -or so, and secure as / hope^ all the advantages 
which I have suggested, as the motives for my delay. 

I trust this plain Statement of facts will justify the course I have 
thought it my duty to adopt under existing circumstances, in the 
opinion of the President and exonerate me from any suspicion of 
desiring to procrastinute for a single moment the earnest desires and 
just wishes of the Executive for a speedy result to the important 
objects committed to my management and which / duly appreciate. 
It is for this reason that I have been so minute^ for which I crave 
your indulgence. 

As regards funds, I have since my last obtained the Cash for my 
draft on the commissioners for £750 St. from the President of the 
United States Bank of Pennsylvania at the instance and through the 
intervention and arrangement of your Minister Grenl. Dunlap who 
will advise the Department by this mail boat of the particulars. 

I have only to say, that while I did not consider it essential to my 
departure to have these funds (for I should have gone without them, 
had it been necessary j or had I embarked before the arrival of Genl. 
Hamilton) yet I confess that the funds were and are desirable on 
my part. I \^as moreover reluctant to assent to any arrangement that 
should absorb.^ even temporally any of the funds, to the credit of the 
Govemmt. in that institution^ but Genl. Dunlap, wishing to promote 
the wishes of tl^e Govemmt. as involved in my mission, had agreed 
upon the arrangement, and when I was called in the Drafts were pre- 
pared and the arrangement concluded, as I did not doubt for a mo- 
ment, that some arrangement would be made by Genl. Hamilton on 
his arrival here to release the funds pledged by Genl. Dunlap and 
cancel that arrangement by assuming my Draft on the Commissioners, 
or what is the same thing giving the bank satisfactory assurances 
that my Bill will be duly provided for.

I have thought proper to advert to this transaction, as Gtenl. Dunlap 
will address you on the subject. I will inform you, before my de-

12 O'clock. 
Sir, 

I fulfil ^he promise made in my last dispatch of 5th inst, (to which 
I beg leave to crave reference) and have to advise you of the arrival 
of the Steamer Liverpool, which left on the 21st Ulto. Genl. Ham- 
ilton, who came passenger, I have just seen for a few moments. He 
said he should write the Govt, himself today; but the press of calls 
upon him, together with a slight indisposition, which he always 
suffers for a few hours after landing, may prevent. I therefore give 
you the substance of the information I have hastily derived from 
him, in case this should reach you before any communication from 
the Genl. himself. Genl. Hamilton has not effected the loan or any 
part of it. He left every thing in a very fair train and with full 
hopes that the negotiation will soon be made. He was offered the 
night before his departure from London to draw for a Million of 
Dollars, which he declined, as he felt confident ere long a better 
negotiation could be made, — ^probably as soon as it was known that 
England (as was believed) as well as France would recognise the

independence of Texas. Mr. Burnley of course remained in Eng- 
land. Genl. Henderson had in fact made a Treaty of recognition, 
but the King, being on a tour though the Departments, could only 
have it laid before him in Council on his return to Paris, then soon 
expected. 

Genl. Henderson would then proceed to England and endeavour to 
effect the same object there ; which Genl. Hamilton thinks is already 
agreed to in point of principle by the English Cabinet, but some little 
time may be required before they can act, in consequence of the 
instructions given to Mr Packenham to mediate between Mexo. and 
Texas. Genl H. said Lord Palmerston does not dout that England 
will recognize, altho' the English presses state that the Govt, had 
declined to recognize. This Sir, is all I can now say — and I hope 
you will hear from Genl. Henderson, as well as Genl. Hamilton 
themselves which are better sources of information than my own 
given from memory and in haste. 

I shall at an early moment explain every thing needful to Gtenl H. 
in relation to my position and run on to Washn. where Genl. Dunlap 
advises me he will have some information for me, that I ought to 
have. I hope to be off by Sunday next^ 13th. or 14th. inst. I feel 
great confidence in my success, and that soon after my arrival out^ 
I shall be able to apprise the President of my favorable progress as 
every thing seems propitious. 

The result of my final arrangements with Genl. Hamilton in rela- 
tion to funds etc — and the information I may derive from Washn. 
shall be given in my next, which will precede my departure for 
Mexico. 

I send papers, to which please be referred for the General news 
from Europe — together with the suspension of Specie payments on 
the part of the U. States Bank and all the other Banks in Phila. and 
Baltimore. The Banks here have not followed the example and I 
think will not if they can help it They will try Iiard and I think 
they will succeed. 

Please present my respectful considerations to the President, who 
I will do myself the honor to address before my departure. 
With great respect 
I am Sir 

Your very Obedt and Hume. Servt.

New York Octr. 23d 1839 
Sir 

I beg leave to refer you to my last communications to your Depart- 
ment of 6th. and 10th. inst, in which I apprised you for the informa- 
tion of the President of the position I was then placed in, and that I 
had deemed it my duty, under the circumstances to postpone my 
departure in the packet of the 6th inst (The First Vessel for any port 
in Mexico since my arrival in this City) and await the arrival of the 
Liverpool Steamer expected by the 8th or 9th inst. She arrived 
on the 10th, and I received all the information from Gen. Hamilton 
that could interest me in the prosecution of the instructions of the 
President. I had previously been urged strongly by Genl. Dunlap to 
visit Washn. and obtain through him such information as he thought 
might be useful to me. 

I therefore left here on the 14 th inst with Genl. Hamilton and 
accompanied him to Phila., Baltimore and Washn., availing myself 
of this opportunity to compare notes with him and obtain every 
information that was desirable. The Genl. left Washn. on the even- 
ing of the 16th for the south, and I had a full and interesting confer- 
ence with Genl. Dunlap during the l7th, and left Washington same 
evening for N. York. I consider this delay therefore (altho' at first 
view a matter of great regret) advantageous, as it has given me 
important data which I could not have obtained without waiting for 
it. Instead of going into further particulars I beg leave to refer you 
to Genl. Hamilton, who I trust will confirm to yourself and the 
President the view taken of the subject. 

And in the same manner I beg permission to refer you to the com- 
munications of Genl. Dunlap in regard to his proceedings at Wash- 
ington for the purpose of aiding me in the execution of my trust, 
and doubt not that he also will consider the delay fully compensated 
by the strength I have gained from these new acquisitions of informa- 
tion. It might be improper for me to enter into any further details 
in matters involving such delicacy and secrecy, since Genl. Hamilton 
verbally and Genl. Dunlap by letter will furnish the Departmt. and 
the President with such details as may be thought proper and expedi- 
ent. I beg you Sir to be assured, and to assure the President, that 
while I am sorry that so much delay has occurred in my final depar- 
ture, yet it has in part been imposed upon me by stem necessity, and 
partly by the deliberate convictions of my duty and I trust that events 
will prove that the time thus lost here will be more than gained on 
the field of action. I crave therefore the favorable consideration of

the President and the Dept. of the facts here submitted and I trust 
that thus far my course will be fully approved, if not in view of the 
expose of the causes which have induced the delay, at least when you 
shall become acquainted through Genls Hamilton and Dunlap with 
all the further particulars. 

While I was in Washn. a vessel sailed hence for Vera Cruz, but 
she was a very dull vessel, deeply laden and indifferently com- 
manded. I could not have gone in her without foregoing the advan- 
tages above adverted to at Washn. and had I been ready, it would 
in my opinion have been better policy to have waited for the present 
conveyance. 

I have now the satisfaction to inform the President through your 
Department that I leave here tomorrow in the Brig Frances Ashbey 
for Vera Cruz direct; she is a good Vessel and commanded by an 
experienced man. I expect to land in Vera Cruz in 16 to 20 days 
and will probably be in the City of Mexo within five days after my 
arrival — say between the 20th and 25th Novr. My friend V.« left 
N. Orleans in the first vessel that sailed for Mexico, say about 1st. 
inst, having embarked for Tampico. I calculate he is now (or will 
be in a few days [)] in the City. 

I expect his advices will be awaiting me at V. Cruz on my arrival 
there, and they may be worth communicating as an indication of the 
feelings of the Govt, in relation to Texas — at all events I cannot I 
think fail to know some thing which will indicate the success of my 
mission a very few days af^er my arrival in the City. I shall avail 
myself of every possible opportunity of apprizing the Department 
of my progress as I am fully aware that time is now all important 
to the Govt. I anticipate therefore that you may expect my advices 
from and after the 1st Decembr. and throughout the whole of that 
month as I may find the facilities of communicating to N. Orleans 
and other Southern ports. I have been thus particular in anticipat- 
ing events because it may aid the Govt, in their plans and views as 
regards the adjournment of Congress. I hope it may set over the 
Holidays that is in Jany, If as I now apprehend the Govt, shall find 
it expedient to submit the result of my Mission (whatever it may be) 
to Congress, or what may be the same thing in effect to obtain from 
Congress such further Legislative authorization as in view of my 
advices, may be deemed necessary to carry out the Negotiation should 
one be initiated. I hope Sir the President and Departmt. will ex- 
cuse these remarks, as in making them I am aware that I am travel- 
ling out of the sphere allotted me. My apology therefore must be 
a strong desire on my part to promote the interest of the Govt, and 
Country in whose service I am now engaged.

Dear Sir 

It is with pain that I announce to you the unhappy news of a 
declaration of war, and an immediate invasion of that flourishing 
and promising country called Texas. 

Owing to an unhappy transaction* which took place lately on 
the Rio Grand must be attributed this precipitate and unlooked for 
movement of the mexican Government. I was aware that an expedi- 
tion was fitting out for that Country for the coming spring and that 
an invasion would be the Result if another internal revolution did 
not prevent it. and efforts have been made by various ways and means 
in order to consolodate the Republic with harmonious feelings to each 
other in order to have security and peace at home, while the Enemy 
was crushed abroad. But owing to the awful fact that their Frontiers 
upon the R. Grand now swarms with enemies of foreign blood • 
presents a scene of such magnified danger to the country that every

consideration of minor importance has been laid aside and the 
comitry with all its towns will be left to the mercy of the Bandit 
hord who may deluge the republic and to the revolting foe. Govern- 
ment under present circumstances cannot stay the depredations of 
the robber; she alone is able to call upon the people in patriotic 
strains to lay down their domestic quarles and here in unusual [?] 
univer[s]al mass to crush the rebel Texian foe and grind to powder 
the more accursed traitors of their own blood attached to that hatefull 
flag. 

The Texians having made their appearance on the frontier has been 
a great stimulent in the hands of this Government in waking up the 
feelings of the people and it is no knowing the forces that will be 
raised. Genl. Arista left here the 19th. For Matamoras with orders 
to draft in every village ; same day left this city 1,300 Infantry and 
Cavelry and some few pieces of Artilery. 

Congress alarmed at the prognostic storm of measures called a 
Junta relative to ways and means to support the campaign, recognis- 
ing at once the proclamation of war. 

Nov 22nd. 

No mail having arrived, I have no news to give of interest. Fur- 
ther than that on the page of yesterday. This city is quiet very 
quiet, conversasions upon the present war are only heard among the 
higher classes. The army which I think will not exceed 15,000 men 
are to be raised out of every department, and it is presumable that 
provisions will be contracted for to feed the Troops in New Orleans. 

From letters received by way of express from Chichuadiua* and 
New Leon other measures are making in raising men for this praise- 
worthy and patriotdc campaign. There is no doubt [the force] will 
amount in all to 20,000 men but I must be permitted to make a de- 
duction of ^ at least for disertion sickness death etc. and From what 
I can learn the campaign will be conducted much in the same way as 
the last. 

The Comanches are most confoundedly battered in the present 
political movement, not knowing which party of Mexicans are their 
friends, and much consultation will be held by their Chiefs previous 
to a final conclusion. 

Report says that the Texians are already on the River (Rio Grand) 
with several schooners of war. That the people of the United States 
are indirectly aiding Texas with means to carry on the war, that her 
old adherents (Texians who formly ^ asserted that Republic citizens 
of the US) have awoke up afresh to a new era of speculation even 
beyond the Rio Grand. That the clustering stars upon the Amercan 
flag have had their song of joy in hopes of an aditional star, even

that of Texas being added to their member. These reports however 
far from the point of truth, bring with them that which will cause 
this people to maltreat the citizens of the U S who are scattered 
through this republic 

Genl. Urrea is shut up in a doleful prision 

A gang of 150 robbers lately nearly swept a whole caravan of 
their* goods. But robbers are so common that but little is said 
about it and stage routs are beset continualy. 

Nov 26th. 

I have been waiting arivals of importance from different parts of 
this Republic, but in vain. 

Every effort is making to raise troops sufficient not only to save 
Matamores and drive the Federals off of the Rio Grand, but to 
invade and retake Texas. Of this there is no doubt, that is of the 
order of Government to that effect. How far they may be able to 
enter into that country you perhaps know better than I can form 
an idea. 

How under the heavens the mexicans can keep together and sup- 
port this army of at least 16,000 men which she is raising is unknown 
to me. 

The patriotic feelings of the people according to what has been 
said and the heads of department out ^ by this time to be shining out 
in splendid offers of presents and loans. But naught is said, even 
[of] the loan authorised by Congress to the National bank of $800,000 
No one as yet (at least up to Saturday last) has offered to loan the 
Junta Govenment^ of Bank a single dollar. I believe therfore that 
the Custom houses will be the only resoures of consequences. 

The army of course (as usual) will have to wait for their pay 
until the war is concluded; and then be put off with a shilling, and 
be even thankful for that. 

But before I conclude this letter permit me to take you in amagi- 
nation to sume towering height near Monterey or durango where 
meets the various divisions that wUl compose this campaign. Look 
to the S. W behold that numerious throng that crowd the high ways, 
these are the troops from Mexico, pueblo and other central districts 
of Mexico, they are the best clothed of any you will see, but they are 
in raggs, many are without hats and many are even without sandals; 
how slow they move, what an awful spectacle of human misery, their 
vivacity has fled for want of the necessaries of life ; a little further 
on are hundreds of poor females following their husbands barefooted 
with their children upon their backs — ^still further on you may see 
in the way they come a continual Hospital of dead and dying. To

Notes. The artilery of Pueblo has been sent against Texas. 

Congress has given the president power to make loans necessary to 
carry on the war against Texas. The $800,000, I understand has 
been excepted. 

Great alarm exists throughout the Eepublic 

Notes Nov 28. 

There are many spies in Texas and I see letters continuely com- 
ming from them advising Mexico of the movement of that Eepublic. 
News comes by way of San Antonio and also from Matagorda etc. the 
lower rout. 

Note. I have just learned, that a Law here has been past and is to 
be put into immediate effect, that of an augmentation of 15 per cent 
on all internal importations of goods — understand me, not on goods 
entered at the sea coast custom houses. The duties there will remain 
the same, but 15 per ct on valuation here on all goods shipped from 
thence for internal consumption. Before the law was 30 per ct on 
amount of import duties, goods now must be sold at 15 pr ct higer. 
this is one of their steps to raise money for the present and future 
wants of Government. 

Nov 28th. 
Mexico it appears, from sources not published, will if she does not 
succeed in the retaking of Texas, and holding the same will if possible 
make some arangement with England, perhaps in the following man- 
ner, as fast as she gets hold of any part of Texas, to place the english 
flag upon the spot, and so on. I have seen in my wanderings in the 
far west a snake. It was furious and f aught long; at length bit itself 
and died. It might have escaped back into its den and have lived 
many years in quiet.

passage of Thirty two days^ during most of which we have had to 
contend with cahns, head winds, and gales; having put into Key 
West for supplies, and on one occasion laid to^ tor five days and 
nighta consecutively. 

This unexpected long passage has been annoying and mortifying 
to me in the extreme^ having counted the tedious hours, as they have 
dragged heavily along; but it is useless to complain of the Elements ^ 
for the " Wind bloweth where it listethJ*^ 

My health, (which was by no means^ good^ when I embarked) has 
suffered somewhat, but I doubt not a day or two of quiet rest will 
restore me and that I shall be invigorated and fully prepared to 
prosecute my delicate and arduous duties with all the skill and energy 
I can bring to bear on so important a matter^ 

Of one thing, I can assure your Excellency, that my efforts shall 
be proportioned to the unexpected delay I have experienced in reach- 
ing here. I take this occasion to remark, that I furnished Gen 
Hamilton with Copies of all the letters I addressed to the LoaAfi 
Com/missioners, as well as to the General himself j none of which had 
been received before his departure from England ; hence^ they would 
all be received by Mr Burnley. The one dated 6th Septr^ con- 
tained my IdeaSy (hastily given) in relation to the Mexican Bonds, 
in England, as having a possible bearing ^ on anticipated negociations. 

I do not knowy that there is any thing in them, worthy of your 
perusal^ but I thought I would mention the fact^ that Gen H. has 
the copies, that you might refer to them. If you thought proper, 
and alsOj to shew to Y. E. that I have thu^ far^ promptly and fully 
complied with this branch of my instructions. I found Gen. H. 
averse to this branch of the operation, for reasons he will undoubtedly 
explain to the President and which, may be found satisfactory, 
aitho^y they were not so to me^ probably because his Views, were not 
fully explained to me. 

I trust my last several letters from N. York are already received, 
with the duplicate of all my letters to the Department; and that 
H. E. the President, will have accorded to me, in the course I have 
felt it my duty to pursue, his favourable consideration.

Sir, 

I beg leave to refer Y. E. to my note of yesterday evening's date, 
written to avail of any opportunity that might perchance offer the 
next morning, but finding no vessel soon for any port in the U. States 
or Havana, it will accompany this communication, and be for- 
warded, the -first vessel which may leave this^ for any neighboring 
Port. 

I have been on shore but two hours^ found my anticipated advices 
from the city of Mexico, one bearing date 19th and ai^other the 23d. 
instant, the writer my friend having passed thro' here to the capital 
about three weeks since^ after being detained at New Orleans by 
severe sickness longer than the period fixed on for his departure. 

He writes me briefly^ of course, as he would not go into any detail 
by letter, knowing that I would repair, as soon a^ possible^ to the 
capital, which he requests me to do. He says, in substance^ that the 
subject matter has been kept alive by those friendly to the measure, 
since the change of the Cabinet, up to his arrived; and more espe- 
cially^ since that period^ awaiting my appearance. That every thing 
still wears a favourable aspect ; and intimates that there had been a 
time, when the matter could have been adjusted in half an hour. 

What is here meant^ I am left to conjecture^ as he leaves all the 
Minutia for a Verbal interview. 

Whatever it may be however^ I am satisfied it does not effect the 
main question^ even now^ or in other words, that the same favourable 
juncture or one equivalent^ may again soon present itself.

502 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCUTION. 

It appears also, that independent of General Annaya's movements, 
the subaltern chiefs of the Federal Party, on the frontiers of the 
Rio Grande^ have encountered the Govmt. Troops at, or near^ Mier, 
and entirely defeated the latter, and were by last advices following 
up their success, by marching towards Matamoros, which poat^ it is 
apprehended by the Govmt. may now fall an easy prey to the federal 
faction so called. 

This event, has recently produced, considerable excitement in Mex- 
ico, inasmuch as, somehow or other, the impression has obtained 
apparent credence with the Govmt. or the Congress that this success^ 
on the part of the Federalists^ was secured by the co-operation of 
Texas, either with the sanction of Govmt. or by its people. 

A warm discussion, therefore recently took place in Congress, in 
relation to this subject, in which the impressions referrd. to were 
admitted, as I a/m informed. I have not seen the report of the dis- 
cussion, but will procure it, and if important^ forward it to the 
Department. 

My friends, however, in the city, wisely anticipating the incorrect- 
ness of these impressions^ would ruullify their eflfects on public opin- 
ion, by some well timed article on the subject, and the affair, has 
already^ or will soon^ blow over, and leave aU as before. I availed 
of this mornings Post for the Capital, to assure my friend (among 
some other matters in reply to his letters) that so far from aid and 
co-operation on your part, cdl overtures^ from beginning to end, had 
been rejected by your Govmt. This assurai^ce will, I trusty be u^d in 
such way as to remove all asperity of feeling arising from this cir- 
cumstance, provided it be not already done by the judicious manage- 
ment of my friends there, as already intimated. 

Meanwhile the Govmt. are sending troops (it is said some 3000 to 
4000) to strengthen Tampico, thinking this aid may be too late to 
secure Matamoros. 

This is the statement I have^ which I presume is mjore or less^ cor- 
rect^ but I have not yet had time to investigate the particulars. 

I am m/yself of opinion that the negotiation to be proposed stands 
now in a favourable position, and so my friend in Mexico assures 
me ; and I shall proceed to the city, as soon as possible, without my 
main object being known to any body here or in the city^ with per- 
haps OTie exception in each place. 

I am now however, in the Roads^ embargoed by a violent norther, 
on board my vessel, whence I had hoped to have landed my luggage 
this morning, but the Gale coming up suddenly, I cannot escape 
until it abates^ as no boat can attempt to land until the sea subsides. 
I hope to Land tomorrow^ however, and leave next day for the city. 
This is all I can now communicate, which I trust will be satisfactory

Dear Sir 

The country is in about the same state of confusion, as when I 
last wrote you Victory or death is the cry in the war department 
Texas must be retaken or Mexico will be lost. 

A law has been past by both houses authorising the president all 
power to procure means (make loans) to carry on the war against 
that Bepublic 

I have just received word from New Leon that 4,000 troops in- 
cluding several pieces of artillery left that country a few days since 
for Matamoris. Also that 750 of the citizens of Matamoris^ in 
favor of Canaliso against the invaders. 
Dear Sir** 

You must not make light of what I write you. It is the truth, 
and the army now under arms amoimts to at least 8,000 men, and 
will be raised to 15,000. I dislike to write bad News, but as I ob- 
tain I hand you as a faithful servant. 

The country of Chichuchua the upper or Northern parts of 
Coahuila and Duranga is left entirely defenceless. East of Rio 
Bravo in Texas north of Lat 30, no enemy except the Indians and a 
few reconnoitering Spaniards exist. 

Texas has many friends in Mexico. The multitude or rable of 
Me2dco (states) would be half reconciled to the change should all 
mexico fall into the hands of the Texians, providing they left alone 
the Churches. The Inteligent Spaniards and strangers are in a

measure friends to Texas and many of the heads of this Govern- 
ment are ready to curse their stars and leave for a more tranquil 
country. 

But notwithstanding all this every nerve is strained to strengthen 
the powers against Texas and nothing but a complete bverthrow of 
the Mexican army will bring them to terms. The first battle will 
tell the story, and the safety of Texas lays in the management of 
the first general battle. 

I am sorry, very sorry that Texas ever made any conditions with 
the Federals or Anglo Mexicans, you will find [them] in the end a 
curse; and my reasons are this; 1st They will never remain loyal 
to strangers, treachery will ever be found in their ranks ; they would' 
aspire to reign over Mexico and should they gain their point, would 
turn upon Texas with as much fury as the present enemy ; I say be 
careful I like not the movement. Texas was growing strong, 
Texas was crowding out the mexicans and no need of bringing on 
them this terable and furious war Had it not been for this present 
movement with the federal [party] in Texas mexico would have slept 
until next summer during which time Texas would have augmented 
her power and means and Mexico fighting one with the other would 
have been spending her little strength, and perhaps no invasion 
would have been made even the following summer, Although prepa- 
rations are making. 

Note you need expect no force by sea. 

Please write me and give me some assurance that I will be rewarded 
for my exersions, as I have been at considerable expense and risk 
and am poor. If you wish me to remain in this country during the 
war pleas inform me of the same. Write to me by my propper name

I have sent you such papers as I have found worth your notice and

sonable offer. With all I see I am not affraid of the little star falling.

here last evening at 5. P. M. and altho' I have not been out of the 
House to day (being a high feast day nothing could be done), I avail 
of this evenings post, in the Hope of its being in time to go by the 
U. S. Sloop, Erie, to say, that so far as I have been able to ascertain 
the state of things here, they are^ as I anticipated from, V. Crm^ favour- 
able — that is, no door is closed against me, and I have the jield open 
as it were, a conference this evening with my Mexican friend (could 
not be to day on a/c of the celebration of Our Lady of Guadalupe) 
will give me further information and point out the course I am to 
pursue and which you shall know by next [post.] As you will readily 
infer from my previous advices, I have to manage with much caution 
and circumspecticm and this will necessarily produce greater delay 
than otherwise would attend my movements. My hopes so far from 
being diminished, since my arrival here, are strengthened, tho I am 
not in possession of any importaivt fact to give me this confidence, but 
it arises from many circumstances, which well examined and weighed 
shew to a careful observer how things stand. You shall hear from me 
evei^ other day until I can come to some conclusion. 
Pardon haste, and believe me very Eespty and 
cordially Yours etc

My dear Sir, 

I beg leave to refer you to my hasty lines of 12th. inst, and now 
fulfil my promise of again addressing you, by this evenings post. 
I beg leave to refer you to the enclosed documents, which you will 
please have translated by some confidential friend, as I have not 
time myself to hand you a translation, as I should wish, if time 
permitted. You may infer from the tenor of this project of a Law^ 
sent to the chambers for its sanction, how strangely things go here 
at the present moment in regard to what interests you and your 
country. This document, together with what I have before said^ will 
shew you without any comment how delicately I am situated, and 
how extremely cautious I am comeplld. to he in all my movements. 
This will prepare you, for soms delay ^ as I have already stated. I 
cannot go into explanations, now of the causes of this state of things; 
Butj I must take them as they are^ and make the most of them. I 
have only been here three days^ but it has been long enough to dis- 
cover something of the difficulty of my position, in the fulfilment of 
your wishes. How to remove these so as to proceed is my present

and immediate task. This done^ I shall entertain some hopes of 
accomplishing something ^ which I trust will meet your approbation, 
and that of the country. But, I cannot, my dear sir, consistently 
with my sense of duty to yourself^ and your Govmt. permit myself, 
to speak other than hypotheticdlly. I only Jinow that the courses I 
have adopted, and shall hereafter adopt (If I have to chxmge my 
measures) are^ and shall be, those in my opinion best calculated to 
succeed, or if unsuccessful^ [I shall] know precisely why and where- 
fore so that your measures may be predicated on certain and 
unquestionable facts and data. I hope^ without being sanguine. I 
must of necessity proceed slow and cautiously, for I am unwilling to 
hazard all at one throw. I am making progress towards som^ results, 
which, if successful, will yet add to my hopes. The first measure 
failing, I have a second^ and if that faUs a third and last^ the failure 
of neither one of which, shall (If I can prevent it) effect unfavov/r* 
dbly^ the next in course. I feel confident that the events of the next 
two weeks will throw further if not final light on the subject. I 
regret that I must still leave you in doubt^ anxious as I know you 
to 6e, but Sir, I rruust write thus until I can see a little further into 
futurity. Be patient with me, my dear Sir, and with me Hope until 
you again hear which shall be soon. Pardon my letter, its style and 
manner. I feel as If I was in [the] wrong in not addressing the 
proper Department, if so, you and the Hon the Secy of State would 
I know pardon me if you knew how I was situated etc 

Please present my respects to the members of the Cabinet (at a

ceive by my letter to you from V. Cruz dated 6th and 7th inst how 
matters then stood, so far as I could then understand them, and I 
referrd you to my several despatches to the Secy of State^ and to 
Gen Lamar (the former semd official, and the latter private) for all 
the details of the position of things as I then could understand them. 
From these papers, you will perceive the difficulties which m^om^nta- 
rUy (at least) surround m^ and the ax^complish/ment of my objects, 
and at same time you will find enough to hang a hope (upon) that 
all tJiese^ might he overcome, as much as to say, / have hopes^ which 
can neither be confirmed nor destroyed^ until I reach Mexico, and see 
how the '^Land lies " I am now here four days and understand some- 
thing of the difficulties, reed and bona fide which I have to remove in 
order to begin fairly. I have addressd two letters to Gren. Lamar 
since my arrival here; say 12th and Hth^ inst, one, I hope will reach' 
the Erie (Sloop of War) and the other, a private Vessel for New Or- 
leans. Should you be in New Orleans on your return from Texas, 
and find them, or either of them, in the hands of Dr. James Ritchie^ 
it has occurrd to me that you might feel authorized to open them, 
or you might be expressly authorized to open see their contents and 
forward. Be this as it may, I now propose to give you [such] 
a view of the present posture of affairs here, as regards my {prospects 
of) success, as may enable you to be governed in your movements 
ojccordingly, I told you verbally^ and repeated it in my Vera Cruz 
letter, that my opinion was and stid is that you should not leave N. 
Orleans for the Norths to return to Europe until you knew the result 
of my mission^ by letters from^ or interview with me. This, opinion 
is based upon the supposition that whether I faU or succeed you and 
the Govnt of Texas ought to hnx)w it before your departure for Eng- 
land, unless indeed there should be something u/rgent — in that case 
letters or a messenger could follow you. Your operations, in my 
humble opinion, might be changed^ the views of the Govmt might be 
altered, a larger amt. than your preserot authority $5,000,000, might be 
requisite, especially if I should have the good fortune to close an 
arrangement. You will have seen that the movement of Ross and 
his party ^^ with other volunteers^ to which they attribute the success 
of tiie federcdists^ and the surrender of the troops in or near Mier^ 
(some 600 men) have produced much excitement on the part of the 
Govmt as well as in the public mind. The Govmt. having taken all 
the measures, in their power, have calld on Congress for special pow- 
ers to levy taxes to support the war against Texas, and to re-unite 
that department to the national union, etc. etc. etc. Not satisfied

with this measure initiated in Congress, and without waiting for the 
action of that body, another project of Law is sent down by the 
Secretary of War (Sr. Almonte) declaring it treason against the 
state for any one " to write act or speak in favour of the views and 
intentions of the Texans; or in favour of the views of any foreign 
power having for its object to dismember the territory of Mexico etc 
The Executive is not of the same mind txoo days in successi'On^ on any 
important matter. The cabinet often divided in opinion and action. 
The counsel of Govmt. often at wctr with the views and wishes of 
the President and his advisers^ and the Govmt. often in a minority 
in congress, even in their favourite measures, and when they make 
the greatest efforts. The Secy of War, who acts with the President 
and one of his colleagues are compromitted before the Public with the 
initiatory measures above cited and everything, is unhinged and 
unsettled, the two great parties in congress^ opposing eax;h other in 
all important measures — OTie in Pro and the other in contra of the 
cabinet. Under these circumstances one would suppose that nothing 
could be cuicomplished^ at the moment^ nor even undertaken with the 
slightest hope of success. But I have (always) found, that to hrvow 
exactly^ the difficvZties or ones position^ is to approximate to their 
removed. So / amfi at work. I could not throw off my incognito 
(which I have managed to preserve until now) because this would 
compel the Govmt. to act^ and to expel me (probably) in order to act 
consistently with their existing and pending m^asu7\ss; and because 
the Press and the public would cry aloud; and the Govmt. would be 
charged, with the privity of my being here^ and suspected of selling 
Texas^ etc. etc. I could not approach Mr Paxakenham^ with, Gen 
Dunlap's letter introducing me officially because 1st. I understand 
from good authority that three times he has verbally appealed to the 
Govmt. that is to two or more of the ministers, offering the medior 
tion, of his Govmt. and has met with a sort of negative, or with 
indifference (at least) on the subject; saying, that until the congress 
had disposed of the measures recommended by the Executive, thro' 
the Secy of War, they must decline any acceptance of mediation, and 
2d. I have not approax^hed Mr Packenha/m, because I am of opinion 
(from cdl I can learn) that other measures which are now in progress 
promise the greatest prospect of success; and until they fail, I shall 
hold in reserve the co-operation of Mr Packenham. There are also 
other, and cogent reasons for this which I cannot now enter uporh, 
(even were it proper) for want of time and room. Again I could 
not or would not sound Mr. Ellis, tho' I have seen him, and by the 
letters I sent him up from V. Cruz he rrmst know my object. Yet I 
have not [ex] changed a word with him nor will I unless he ap- 
proaches me, and then, even, I must be cautious. Now, none of these

things could I do^ or attempt to do, without risking too much on 
one throw and hazarding the hetter prospect of other preliTninary 
measures^ which^ tho' they fail^ would not destroy the chances of the 
other steps^ or measures which I have for the present only deferrd. 
This is about all I can say, for it would be improper to detaiJ, too 
rruach. Suffice it to say that my ffrsft effort has been and «, to destroy, 
or neutralize J the two measures of the Govmt. (the two Iniciatives) ^ 
The first asking for ways and means to, bring Texas into the Union^ 
(That w, go to war with Texas) and the second^ is declaring it treason 
etc. to speak write, or art etc.^ If I can cause these projects to be 
rejected by the Deputies, the Govmt. will perceive that its views are 
not supported by the chamber, and then will change their ground 
(probably) and can be approached. And here I must explain what 
I have omitted in its proper place that you will comprehend the 
wh/>le ground. The first initiative referrd. to has tv>o counts — 1st, 
The Oovmt. asks for ways and means to carry on the war as above, 
and the second count asks congress for authority to adopt all neces- 
sary measures, Political and military. This word political (in the 
original Politico-militar), it is believed, is intended, by the Govt, to 
m£an authority to negotiate; That is to say, the Govmt. has askd 
congress for means to carry on the war and at same time to negotiate. 
The expression, politico, is indeed very narrow. To base authority to 
negotiate, either for a sale, session, or recognition; but this is one way 
of doing things here, as they can amplify and interpret anything to 
suit their views. With this explanation, you have the whole proposi- 
tion of the Govmt. to congress. Tomorrow I may be able to add the 
report of the Committee on both points, tho' not the final action of 
the House. Now, the Govmt. tuis been induced to ask for the second 
power (to negotiate) from one of two causes — viz. 1st. in consequence 
of Mr. Packenhams repealed proffer of mediation, which has been 
constantly declined (at least until the result of the action of the 
chamber should be known etc) or 2d. in consequence of some of the 
members of the cabinet having been approached on the subject of 
re-cognition, limits and compeTisation, by my dii^ectuyn, and thro' mA/ 
friends here, before and since my arrival. One or both of these 
motives have induced the Govmt. to ask for powers to carry on the 
war, or make a peace, as we will call it, for shortness and clsamess. 
The responsibility is thus thrown on congress, and in any event, the 
President and Govmt. will escape censure. If the chambers refuse 
the s^ipplies the Govmt. will say we asked and urged the ways and 
means; congress refused them; we have done our duty — theirs is 
the blame. If they refuse the powers political (or to negotiate), the 
Govmt. will say, we asked for both, powers to make war or peace. 
Congress would grant neither. Now the Gt)vmt. has done its diity,

let congress dispose of the whole qv£8tion etc. etc. as it pleases. So 
you will perceive thM the Govmt. are afraid to move any negotiation 
having for object a recognition or an agreement in consequence of 
their weakness and unpopularity^ as the opposition in and oui of 
congress^ would powrvce on the Gk)vmt. and try to make it a pretext 
for the President to cJumge his cabinet or produce a revolution. But 
if congress (the Deputies) throw out the whole matter^ or so modify 
and ham/per the views of the Govmt. as to render the measures a 
nuLlity (which is probable and so I hope) then the whole matter 
under consideration is given up^ and the field is open^ and a resolution 
may emanaie from the chambers and be adopted by the Senate giv- 
ing full and clear powers to the Govmt. sufficient to enable Govmt. 
to negotiate and close^ an arrangement. The Govmt. then may be 
induced to listen to m^, or to rwy propositions for peace and recogni- 
tion^ without the responsibility which would otherwise attach to 
them^ and if we can ajgree and the arrangement falls within the 
scope of the powers conferrd. by Congress on the Govmt. the matter 
can be closed without any further legislative action here; I will, only 
require the ratification in due form of the authorities of Texas^ to be 
binding on both Govmts. Altho' the exchange may be delayed until 
the pecuniary stipulation is fulfilld by Texas, say soon.^ 

These, my dear Sir^ are some (not all) the difficulties which sur- 
round us, and compel me to adopt a prudent and cautious course^ not 
to risk dU on the main question^ at the first^ start^ reserve a shot or 
two in the locker^ so that my f,rst defeat shall not be exactly final. 
The ground I occupy and the course I am tww preliminarily pursu- 
ing is to see how the question stands^ and confirm by further observa- 
tion how far I am rights and if I have to change my ground^ or 
modify my measures or not, I think I hear you say (and also our 
friend Love, who I suppose may be with you in N. Orleans) well^ you 
have a hard row to hoe; so hard that you never will get through. 
You have undertaken too much and I have no hopes of any favour- 
able result etc. To this I reply th<it I am here. I know my friends, 
and they are active in their steps, and / hope something will come out 
at last. I must judge and act for myself^ with all the light and aid 
I can borrow^ move cautiously and do my best. I have given you 
here only a sketch of the «^a/6 of things^ omitting the measures I have 
already^ and (im now hourly taking to secure my ends. Time 
is essential^ tho^ not a moment shall be Z^«^. You mt/«^ be patient and 
await the result. In a t^j^^A I can I think further report (and I A<9p^ 
favourable) progress. But formidable obstacles must be overcome by 
conviction and persuasion. I trust you will understand me. There 
are (mZy ^t«?<? t^jay^ Tiere.

Decb. 17th.— Tuesday 6PM 
Important business and the storm has detained me, and I am left 
with only an hour's time before the mail. I have glanced over the 
two sheets enclosed which must suffice. I would have copied them, 
but have no time. I am compelld to write wJien I can^ and as I cam^ 
out of my own Hotel. You must therefore excuse all, and see if 
you can make it out and understand it. I have extended my remarks 
so much further than I had intended that I have to request that after 
perusal you will send it to the Govmt. That isj the President^ if you 
think best^ or if not the Secy of State. I say this because I presume 
a careful perusal, will be all you want and it is too long to copy. 
Therefore^ please forward it, as ahove, with your remarks. I will 
address it to you absent to Col Love^ so that should you be absent Col 
Love will copy it, or that part of it which he may deem important 
and then send you the original^ or place it in the Hands of Jas. Reed. 
No time for more. 

I am Yours Very cordially , J. Treat

Dr. Sir 

If this should reach your hands consider as for you. I cannot 
write much now for a thousand reasons. If Gen H is there, you and 
he will decide whether it^ or its substance is worth transmitting. If 
Gen H is not there, you will act as you may think proper, always 
giving Gen H the original^ or placing it under cover to Reed & Co., 
James Reed. This will be enclosed to Dr James Ritchie. My last 
two letters to the President are short and do not contain so much 
detail. I am this moment informd. that the Govmt have received an 
Express informing them that Matamoras has fallen to the federals, 
and Tampico threatned. My affairs have moved well to day.

COBRESPONDENCB WI^^E MEXICO. 513 

16th. and 17th inst, I was about addressing (you) another communi- 
cation, giving some details of the state of things, and my own move- 
ments etc, when, I found by my last advices from Gen. Hamilton, 
and also from Col Love, that the former expected to be in N. Orleans 
again on his return from Texas, about the 20th inst., and the latter 
named the same period for his visit to New Orleans, both soliciting 
my advices, and especially Gen H. who might be on his way to 
Europe, possibly without knowing anything of my progress since 
leaving V. Cruz. Under these circmnstances, and conceiving it very 
important for Gen H. to know the exact position of my mission as 
near as I could give him particulars I resolved to write him at length, 
which I have done, but under circumstances in which I could not 
preserve a copy without missing a mail, which would have been to 
miss the vessel at V. Cruz, which was to convey it to N. Orleans. I 
cannot, therefore, furnish you with a copy ; but I have addressed the 
despatch to Gen. Hamilton, absent^ Col. Love, and dii^ected Dr. 
Ritchde accordingly. I have requested both (whichever might receive 
it) to copy that part of said letter which they might consider impor- 
tant either to yourself or the Hon. the Secy of State, or to send the 
original^ after perusal, that yourself might add the contents of this 
dispatch to Gen. Hamilton, to my former two advices, in copy here- 
withj 80 that up to 17th. evening^ you will know all I could safely 
conmiunicate. All I can therefore do is to refer (you) to said letter, 
not doubting that my said letter to Gen Hamilton will find its way 
to the Govmt. either in copy, or original. I will then suppose you in 
possession of said letter, and my other two, being all I have written 
from this City, and proceed on in my narrative, so far as I can speak 
of facts, and as may be necessary for Y. E. to understand the subject 
generally. The special committee referrd. to in my last letter, 
reported against the powers politico-nUlitareSj and especially the 
former branch of said powers, and altho they authorized the Gtovmt. 
to proceed with the projected expedition, it was under the ordinary 
and constitutional powers of the Govmt. And instead of reporting 
ways and means promptly and abundantly, they recommended meas- 
ures that would give the Govmt. some $250 to 300,000 Dolls and could 
not be collected (if at all) in less than three to 4 months. This 
report of the Committee was opened for discussion on the 17th. and 
at the close of the Hour, the House adjourned, after calling on the 
Secretary jof War, Mr Almonte^ to be present the next day to explain 
the views of Govmt. as involved by the initiative^ and on the 18th the 
Minister appeared in his plaice. December ilst. The discussion com- 
menced, and the Secy of War, Gen. Almonte, defended the course of 
the Govmt. Endeavoured to shew, the importance, the urgent neces- 
sity of taking immdiate and active measures against Texas. That 
the Govmt. had done, prelimilarily^ all its means and powers had

enabled it to do, 2ind.now [wished] to carry out their views to some 
favourable result and prevent the evils that would otherwise ensue, 
etc etc etc. The Executive calld. on Congress to give him the powers 
nskd. for, and the means (pecuniary) to carry out his policy. His 
remarks, which I heard, were very common place, and the general 
opinion was that during the whole discussion, he acquitted himself 
very indifferently. This, especially, was my own opinion. He was 
repeatedly asked, what were the measures contemplated by the 
Govemt. military or political; but declined, as often^ to throw any 
light on the subject ; remarking that to state to the chambers the plans 
of Govmt. as regards Texas would be to say to the Texavs^ " We are 
going to proceed against you, thus and so; therefore, prepare your- 
selves, etc etc etc etc This discussion was not general^ but confined 
(with one exception) to the three members of the Special Committee, 
who had sent in their report against the initiative of Govmt. as 
already explained. These Gentlemen (and especially a Priest who is 
President of the Chambers, {Speaker of the House) ) defended their 
report, spoke with great freedom, complained of the Secy of War 
and the Govmt. who came down with their request for special powers 
and means, but refused to state hxrw they were to use them. The 
speaker made the closing speech^ lathed the Secy of War and the 
Govmt. very cleverly, spoke till the Hour had expired, and then 
adjourned the House, thus preventing Genl. Almonte from replying 
until the next day, 19th. when the House opened and the Secy took 
the floor. He had, on the day previous assumed a tone of importance, 
Handled one of the members uncourteously (to say the least) and 
treated the House, as I thought^ disrespectfully. On the 19th. he 
appeared differently, and was quite modest and mild in his carriage 
and his Language, and instead of replying to the Speakers closing 
speech against him, he commenced by re-iterating his views and those 
of his Gormt., attaching vast importance to immediate action, and 
cited authorities and precedents to shew that similar powers had been 
asked for and granted by Congress on occasions of much less magni- 
tude than the present, etc etc etc. To which the Committee (two of 
them) replied at length and I thought^ triumphantly; destroying the 
l)recedent cited, and pointing out the enormous evils and abuses which 
had grown out of said powers, one speaker (of the committee) said, 
in substance : As regards the naked question of restoring Texas to the 
Union etc there was probably but one opinion in the House, hut of 
what use was even that unanimity^ unless some one could state where 
the means was to come from? whether this was the proper time to 
undertake so difficult an enterprize? and what were the prospects of 
final success. The Committee could not see where the means were to 
come from. The Govmt. and the Secretary had been calld upon by 
the Committee, before they had reported, and could obtain no light.

Hence their report^ now under consideration, against the powers 
asked for. Before I proceed to the result of that day^ the 19th. I will 
remark hriefly; that thus far^ no member had taken the floor to sup- 
port the views of Govmt. nor those of the Secretary. The three 
members of the Committee supported their report, and one member 
(the only other one who said a word thus far) opposed the secretary's 
views, but not on the same grounds as the committee, who a<;ted 
together. While Gen. Almonte replied by repeating what he had 
before said, with much greater earnestness than force^ and concluded 
by expressing a wish that the House would return to the Committee 
their Report with instructions to report a bill in conformity with the 
project of the Govmt. that would give them, the Govmt^ ample means, 
and such as could be realized promptly, to carry on their plans; in 
which case the Govmt. would hold itself responsible — otherwise^ the 
chambers would have to assume that responsibility ^ as regards the 
public; and also^ all its fatal consequences etc etc. In this stage of 
the matter, the committee consulted, and seeing that there was too 
much of long shot in the struggle, and wishing to bring the question 
home at once to the House, one of them stated that there were reasons ' 
which he had not given why this matter should be discussd. on 
broader principles than those^ merely involved in their report and 
that he might explain, at full lengh, those reasons, and his own views, 
he moved that the discussion be continued, with closed doors, and 
pennd. his resolution, to which there were some objections oflferd. by 
tw© or three members, who had thus far been silent; but these seemed 
to be a* ^o the form or the rules of the Housey etc. and not to the 
resolution itself. The proposition was modified and altered, and still 
objected to, when the President (Speaker) decided the resolution to 
be in order^ and the Galleries were cleared at once. And here Sir, I 
must suspend my report (so far as this dispatch is concerned which 
I propose to send this evenings post) because I am not fully advised 
of the proceedings after closing doors on the 19th, nor of what trans- 
pired yesterday; and much less^ the result of today. This will be 
given in my next dispatch, when I shall know all that occurrd, and 
probably some result, all which shall be promptly communicated, so 
far as my letters are concerned; for all I can do is to write often and 
transmit my letters to my faithful and intelligent friend in Vera- 
Cruz, to be forwarded by the most available opportunities, either 
direct or indirect. I have to regret (and very much) that since my 
arrival at V. Cruz there has been only two opportunities to convey 
my advices to you : The Sloop of War Erie^ and the Brig Frances 
Ashbey; former for Balize, or Pensacola, via Tampico^ and sailed 
14th inst; and latter^ to sail on the 23d. inst for N. Orleans; so that 
this communication, will not reach her^ but must take its chance. I 
have thought it expedient not to use the channel, via Tampico, for I

do not consider it, in any degree safe. I wish my dear Sir, I could 
give you something more positive; more satisfactory, more conclusive, 
or even more indicative of -fkud results. But 1 do aUl can, when I 
inform you of all the movements here thus far; or at least^ all that I 
can with propriety now communicate. Let me secure the prelimdnarr/ 
vantage ground I am thus far contending for; and I will then per- 
haps be more explicit. 21st. 8 P. M. As much from indisposition 
as from want of time, I cannot extend my remarks much; but wiU 
try to fill my last page Gen Hamilton, among other matters, urges 
me to confine m/y whole efforts to obtain the mediation of G. BritoAn^ 
and merely stipulate that negotiations shall be forthwith opened in 
London, under the above mediation, having for object peace^ recogni- 
tion^ indemmty etc etc. You will see what I have said to the (Jeneral 
in my letter^ on receiving it. There are serious objections to the 
adoption of this recommendation. I have therefore not delivered 
Gen. Dunlaps letter of introduction, which discloses my character. 
Gen. H. informs me that he, addressd. him direct^ and told him I 
. would call and confer with him confidentially. This was very weU^ 
but I have to regret that Gen H did not enclose these letters to me^ 
and send me copies; that / might judge when to deliver them and 
know Jiow far to go with Mr Packenham. Then the Cabinet would 
not have been hampered with reiterated proffers etc etc. Then I 
could have followed my own course^ undisturbed by Mr P. If I 
failed^ I could then approach Mr P. with the same and greater claims 
on his intercission or intervention. 

This I shall do yet if riecessary. Things this evening look very fair.

Mexico Cmr Dec 25th. 1839 
To Mr Wm. Bryan, Consul of Texas 
Dear Sir 

Since last I wrote this country has remained much the same, every 
exertion has been made to increase the army in order to subdue the 
Rio Grand Rebels and Texians. I know not how It is that an alliance 
has been made between the Federals and Texians, but sometimes think 
that the Texians who are with Canales Zapata etc have gained the 
Federals upon their own responsibility, but let this be as it may, 
The Government of Mexico seems to be convinced that the Govern- 
ment of Texas has an active part in the invasion of Mexico, and will 
strain every nerve to retake that colony. Since my last dates 
Congress has voted a bill of loan or invested the President [with 
power] to raise five hundred thousand per month during the Texian 
war (by what means I know not). 

I believe It is now certain that the Federals and Texians are in 
possession of Matamoris, that Khenocero above that has fallen liquise 
into their hands and the French minister informed me yesterday that 
the Federal or Texian army was forty miles this side Matamores on 
their way to Tampico. I think you may rely on this as matter of 
fact, although the Government pwiy here are as quiet about it as can 
be possible. 

General Arista, is raising his voice in the country of Zacatecas and 
around that country with the most pathetic strains possible but had 
not on my last accounts been very successfuU. I think from what I 
can learn that the whole Mexican army on the frontier states have 
not amounted as yet to 8,000 men having fallen short nearly have * 
their, calculation However every thing is doing that can be done. 

I told you some time since that an expected revolution was expected, 
and I now repeat that it is supposed to be now at the very point of 
eruption.

pendent communications, not as inclosores.

Bustamente appears to be good a man, but he is short of.« Too 
slow to punish the averred Robbers that infest the country. Too 
negligent to reward the good. Had he the energy and penetration 
of Santa Ana combined with his goodness of heart, he would be 
able to do much good in the moralizing of Mexico. 

Bustamenta it is now learned will not take the command of the 
army. General Arista is to have the honour, he is said to be a fine 
officer (Arista) though I am told he learned his trade in Cincinnati 
Ohio, not of fighting but the sadlery business. 

Poor FUasoIa, when I see him I have to laugh — ^thinking of the 
burlesk written of him and Santa Ana making them escape from 
San Jasinto on a log. But he is a fine old fellow no doubt at least 
strangers speak well of him; he is General in Command here and 
when a friend asks him what of Texas, he will shake his head, screw 
up his shoulders and say "i/y Friend Texas is lost to Mexico we 
wiU never he able to retake itJ*^ 

I think since the last unfavourable accounts that the Centrals have 
lowered much in their sanguine hopes of victory, and some may be 
seen muffled up in their mormans cloaks (of twelve yards of cloth) 
with faces hanging down as long as the moss of a Mississippi cypress. 

Santa Ana to the joy of strangers and to the regret of fools was 
supposed to have quit the world, and gone to Texas or some. other 
good world where he would have received his just reward for all 
his rascality numerous as the stars and mountain high that he has 
been guilty of during the last 40 years. But he has recovered of 
the disentery, and is brewing some infernal schemes; he is soon ex- 
pected at this city as general dictator of ways and means, and [will] 
take the reigns of Government into his own hands, and then like the 
Tripple Headed Potentate of Hell (of Rome) grasp to himself 
regardless of shame or pity the little wealth of good remaining to 
this almost sinking country. This character here a God ! It is as 
black with crime as the accursed fiend himself ! 

Dear Sr 

I must beg pardon. I am not in the habit of breaking out in such 
unbecoming strains, but I beheld before me so much misery caused 
by this man, his treachery, hypocracy and ambitious views, his dep- 
redations and his want of mercy, of pity of shame accused traitor to 
honor, to hospitality indebted to a people for his life who has since 
endevoured to destroy. 

Who saved him from the wrath of the texians when a prisoner? 
who fed him? who watched the movements of those who would have 
poisoned him? who waited on him like a brother? Look at the at- 
tention of Col Bee for this more than monster in the shape of man

setting aside the many others that treated him as an honourable pris- 
oner of war. 

Yet he was the first to declare war, the first to order Col Bee back 
from whence he came, when Gtel Victoria and others would have been 
reconciled to a reconciliation between the two countries. 

I conclude dear Sir these remarks by informing you that I have 
but little doubt if the Federals mark their cards aright but that they 
will gain their point and then I have no doubt but Texas will be 
declared free and recognized

Wright to Brtan.*^ 

City of Mexico Dec 27th. 1839 
Dear Sir. 

In my letter of the 25th Inst I wrote you that Matamores had 
been taken by the Federals and Texians. But an express came here 
to day to the Secretary of War bringing information that Gtenl 
CanaUso had driven off the besiegers, and that General Arista had 
not arived when this took place. This account having arived by ex- 
press it is presumable is correct, you will however be informed of 
the truth of this before this letter can reach you. 

At heart Mexido is determined to show the Texians fight, let the 
consequence be what it may. 

I am afraid to hold out encouragement, to you owing to my being un- 
certain as to the feelings of the people at large, and shall only inform 
you that 2/3rds of the strangers here would be glad to see the country

in the hands of the Texians. The people on Rio Grand are much 
divided in oppinion, much of their patriottism is lost for the patria 
and [they] think that they would live just as well under the Federal 
Government or Texian as they do now imder the Central Govern- 
ment. 

I repeat what I wrote the other day that the Mexican Government 
is thimder struck at the poor turn out of the patriots, and the slow 
augmentation of the army. Greneral Arista, and Greneral Reyes and 
others are appealing to the people in the most patriotic strains to 
rally to the standard of war, in order to save the country from the 
traitors, pirates rebels and savages whose sole aim (they say) "are 
to rob you of your wives your children, lay waste your Farms, bum 
and destroy your property, change your laws, in fine enslave you like 
they would the black man." 

I might translate you pages of the like proclamations. But it 
would be a waste of time, and be but little benefit to you or yours. 

We still await a revolution. It would I presume be favourable 

I have conversed with many indirectly even among the members of 
Congress, and some there are sorry very sorry that Texas could not 
have been recognized for the good of the country instead of this 
expensive war. Even in the very hall I heard it thundered from the 
bench "Why in the name of God could there not have been some- 
thing done e're this for the pacification or subjection of that colony 1 " 
Again was said by the same speaker, " I have no faith in those reni- 
gade Federals. Federal, did I say? They deserve the name not of 
Federals, but that of traitors, black as the ruined fiends of hell do I 
view these accursed bands of Zapata Canalis, and [with] Rey « Jesus 
Christ at their head am of opinion that nothing good could procede 
from them." It was plainly evident that he was a friend to 
Texas, etc. 

Again Dear 

You will excuse my following propositions. 

1st. I would propose that a proclamation should be drawn by the 
head department of * declaring to the people of Mexico that 

neither their religion nor their churches in case of invasion should 
be molested farther then for the essential good and happiness of the 
people; 

2nd. That all prisoners of war would be treated with humanity, 
and that all who wished to take side with ^ would be received 

with open arms, and asure them that nothing like slavery should 
exist in the country. And that every pains would be taken to estab-

beyond anjrthing you could expect. The same might by yourself be 
remitted to me, I am cap[ab]le to have [it] distributed in a far

not risk[ed] in a country of enemies, have I not scowered the whole 
Comanche world, have I not appeard like the evil one in a thousand 
differnt places in this bandit country. And for all this, what is my 
prospect A prision in this accursed country, without means or 
friends to fee a lawyer to get me out. Dear Sir I do not complain 
but I am in the dark I am even not convinced that I am even 
known by the Republic. I could do much good had I sufficient 
funds and authority Yes Sir had I the authority of Col Bee, I 
should watch my opportunity in case of change in this Government 
and some favourable moment ask for a Recognition of the Republic 
without fear of being disapointed. The people have nothing to 
say here A few say and do all, and these few are half convinced 
that a recognition would be for the best. I do not pretend that I 
am as capable as many others for the above mentioned, but where is 
there a man who will come here risking his life as I have done, and 
I can assure [you] that the danger is not small. The Government 
has published again and again latterly that every man would be 
considered a traitor who gave any accounts directly or indirectly to 
strange or foreign nations or to the enemy. 

But setting all aside you may rely on my fidelity and all I ask is 
that my letters may be answered in a proper way. If my services 
are acceptable inform me of the same, if not dismiss my services, and 
I will return from the field. 

Note 

A runaway Mexican from Texas has brought word that Nacog- 
doches had been taken by the Cadoes, Cherekees and Choctawes and 
that 30 Texians had been murdered lately near Behar (San Antonio) 
by the Comanches leaving not one to take home the unfortunate news 
of their deaths. I cannot vouch for its truth.

CX)HBESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 523 

Treat to Lamar.<» 

Private. Duplicate. City of Mexico, Deer, Slst. 1839. 

Tuesday A. M. 
My dear Sir. 

Since my last respects of [20th] instant, to which I beg reference, 
we had a continued Holiday ^ (which, I think I have already men- 
tioned, as a week'*8 lost time, for all public matters) as no current 
biosiness of any kind is transacted, and many of the Public Men 
leave the city for the country. It is now almost over (thank for- 
tune) and on Thursday next, 2d. Jany. everything will resume its 
usual course^ and progress be made on the part of Congress. Neither 
myself^ nor my friends^ have been Idle during this interval of pub- 
lic business^ and I am happy to say, I have made some progress in 
my affairs. I have, in my former communications, given you suffi- 
cient evidence of the Up Hill Job I have in hands, and I will say 
no more on tfds pointy lest you should think the difficulties unsur- 
m^ountable^ and hence, infer that I can bring nothdng about. It will 
be time enough to go into further details^ when I have the pleasure 
of taking you by the hand. My last advices left Congress in Secret 
Session^ which continued for 3 or 4 days. The Secy, of War, en- 
forcing the claims and desires of the Executive, as regards the 
powers^ and ways and means^ involved in the project sent down to 
the Chambers; and of course opposing the Report of the Corrmdttee^ 
which refused said powers. To support all which, the Hon Secy 
made use of arguments based upon his own mere assertions^ and 
which he vouched for as facts which / cannot now repeat, but which, 
if known, would excite a feeling of disgvst and surprize, very diffi- 
cult for m^ to describe. 

On the other hand, the Comrmttee^ and others who acted with 
them and against the Secretary, insisted upon it; That this was not 
the time to attempt to raise ways and means to undertake a new 
campaign against Texas. That the wants of Govmt. for oth^r pur- 
poses greatly exceeded its means; and that the true question was 
whether this was not rather the tirfie for some arrUcdble arrange- 
menty — some negotiation which would redound more to the interests 
of Mexico than to oppress the people for Means to com/mehce what 
would probably never be carried to an issue. Here you see, was a 
direct issue of opinions, brought about purposely by my movements. 
Enough was of course said to shew that overtures were now^ or 
might soon be, pending on the part of Texas somewhere for a friendly 
arrangement honorable and advantageous to Mexico. The Question, 
however before the House was on the reception of the Report of the 
Committee, which was decided in the Negative; so the Report was

peturnd to the Committee for revision. That Committee will adopt 
one of two courses. 1st. Let that subject die on their hands^ and 
make no further report (as is common here) and, in that case,* a 
resolution will be offerd. from some other quarter^ authorizing the 
Govmt. to negotiate such an arrangement of peace and Recognition 
with Texas as in its opinion is conformable to the honor and interests 
of the Country (or something tantamount^ but in their ovm ambig- 
uovs style) — or 2dly. The said Committee, if it sends in an amended 
report^ will add this Resolution (or something equivalent) to ity 
and in either case the sense of the Chambers will be known. We 
hope for a majority on this question, when it does come up, but 
as we are gaining ground every day^ we do not like to accelerate the 
vote too much. We feel almost sure in the Senate now, and If we 
can, get the authorization from the House, there is little doubt but 
the Government will embrace the negotiations thus opened by Con- 
gress, and the responsibility of action thereon thrown upon the 
Executive. This course was deemd. not only necessary but decidedly 
the best, as it was well Known that the Executive and Cabinet, would 
never m^ve or'iginally on this question. But it seems moraUy cer- 
tain that the Initiatory being taken by Congress, the Executive will 
act. Another advantage in this coitrse is that, managed in this way^ 
there is no ratification necessary on the part of Congress, of the 
doings of the Executive; which, being within the Sphere of the 
authorization of Congress (and for this purpose it will be ample) is 
final, and can be kept a secret during the pendency of the question, 
and longer if desirable. I trust, I have said enough to convince you 
that my first step (under all the circumstances) has been a safe and 
judicious one. 

Should you doubt however, I can, I think, on a more full view of 
the whole ground, satisfy you that it was my best course. Perhaps, 
however, we shall not try the mAiin question until we are moraUy sure 
of the result in our favor. If we fail, I shall then approach the 
Govmt. direct, and make all the impression I can on them, which will 
not be small, after all that has passed on the subject, and which of 
course I cannot now relate. If I find the aid of Mr. Packenham de- 
sirable or necessary I will invoke it at once, for thus far I have not 
seen him, nor am I aware that he knows I am in the city ; tho', I am 
rather inclined to think he does, from (}en. Hamilton's letters to him, 
and the alm^ost consequent inquiries he would naturally make con- 
ceming me. I have abstained from seeing Mr. Pa/ikenham until 
now; 1st Because I am advised that his profferrd. mediation of Eng- 
land in the affairs of Mexico a/nd Texas has not been definitively 
acted on by this Govmt, which awaits the final action of Congress to 
reply to Mr. Packenham. 2d. I am afraid that if Mr Packenham, 
assumes his mediatorial action here, or even his good offices are in-

yoked by both parties, the question of Texas Quota of the Public 
Debt would be brought up and produce Embarrassment and delay, 
if nothing worse. 3d. I have not yet ascertained, to my entire satis- 
faction^ what were the conditions on which the Old English Bonds 
were converted into n.ew ones; that isj whether Mexico is bound by 
this new arrangement to pay to the Bondholders the proceeds of any 
Sale or cession of Texas? 

This doubt, I have found great diflBculty in Solving, as the decree 
of Congress authorizing it was general and plenary under which 
Govmt. axited^ and the proceedings have never seen the light here. I 
have now taken suflScient measures to know all I desire on this head. 

When I know, I shall be governed axicordingly, as the issue of this 
question, (if it should appear that the Bondholders are entitled to 
proceeds of Sale of Texas) may induce some change in my proceed- 
ings, tha;t is J some variation in the modus operandi. 

Gen. Hamilton has based his recommendation, that I should go for 
English mediation only ; and merely arrange for opening the negotia- 
tion in London on the supposition that the money goes to the Bond- 
holders. It may be true, but there is some reason to think otherwise. 
I shall soon be relieved from all doubt. If, then, I am compelld. to 
use Mr. Packenham's influence or induced from Policy so to do, I can 
do so soon, or make it my last resort. This statement, I think, in 
addition to what I have before advised you, will give you as full a 
picture of the present posture of affairs as / can well draw under the 
circumstances. Of course I have not told you all; only^ some of the 
leading features; the rest you must g'uess at for the present, and until 
I am better situated to give details than I am now. 

All which is most 

Respectfully submitted. 

Continuation. 

January Ist. 1840. 
Myself and my friends are all alive to the importance of the sub- 
ject under my charge, and nothing is left imdone that can by possi- 
bility increase the chances of success. By the 10th. to 15th. inst 
I hope I can state my own opinion of results with more confidence 
than I dare now. At present, I will only say that I have gained 
as much ground as I could have anticipated, and I still have hopes 
of success. This goes to Vera Cruz, in the hope that it will be in 
tim^ for a Vessel for N. Orleans of which I was only advised by last 
post. If it does it will accompany my last respects, and you will 
receive them together. If not it will go pr. Eng. Packet, via Havana, 
and thence to N. Orleans. I have letters from Mr Burnley, at N. 
York, with a copy of his letter to m^ from London 5th. Octr.; 
original not received. Please thank him for them, if with you, as I

have not time nor health to write him now. I have duly noted the 
important (in a certain event) contents of his letter of 5th Octr 
from London, a copy of which you would, I tMnk^ like to have in the 
State Deft. This is a miserable Winter's climate, and my health 
suffers much. This is the coldest winter ever known here. We are 
daily expecting news from Matamoras^ last accounts having left 
CaTiales in the vicinity of that place, making some movement, which 
is here reported as a withdrawal of his troops. We know Nothing 
but what the Govmt. chooses to publish. It is the strangest place 
for news I have ever seen. I hardly know which party to wish 
successful. If by defeating Canales^ the Govmt. Ibere should be 
Strengthened^ then I say, let Candles he defeated. For one of the 
things I most apprehend and an evU as much to be fectred as any 
other single one whatever is the weakness of Govmt. which will make 
them, I fear, when it comes to the pinch^ afraid to do what their own 
convictions assure them is the hest^ the only policy Mexico can adopt 
with Safety or advantage. If I had only to convince a majority of 
both Houses of Congress — a majority of the Cabinet and the Presi- 
dent — and more than half the Sensible men who, besides the above^ 
are in office, and the same proportion of intelligent men out of office 
whose opinions would be worth something^ of the policy adva/nr- 
tages^ nay^ the necessity of an amicaile arrangement nowj I would 
say to you. Sir, " I wUl accomplish your wishes^ only give me a 
little time?'^ I should honestly believe I could make good my word. 
But when all this is done^ then comes the fears^ doubts^ and appre- 
hensions^ of consequences — whether it will prove unpopulary whether 
the Cabinet will be broken up and lose their places — and whether a 
Revolution, might not be the Consequence, etc., ^c. Hence the 
necessity of dii^iding up the responsibility beginning with Congress^ 
and placing the Executive and Cabinet in an easy position to act, 
while the public and even Congress itself may be ignorant of what 
is reaUy going on. It is only thus^ we trusty they will be able to get 
over the anticipated diflSculty. 

They are too weak^ too irribecHe^ too much divided among them- 
selves and afraid of each other to ax;t straight forward^ boldly and 
openly^ however clear they may be that they are right in point of 
fact: 

With these additional remarks^ you can hardly faU to see how 
things stand now; and you may, perhaps, form your own opinion of 
probable results^ even on receipt of this and all my former despatches. 
/ say StiCl^ my dear Sir^ I have hopes of success. I regret I cannot 
always hand you duplicates^ but my health and circumstances have 
not on tlxis occasion permitted. The Extreme precautions I take 
will, I trusty secure the safe arrival of my originals^ salvo loss of ves- 
sels. Be pleased to look over the style of my communications, and

few words, hoping it will reach the U. S. Sloop Ontario, to sail 10th 
or 11th for Balize or Pensacola, having just heard of her arrival at 
Vera Cruz, where, it appears, she makes an unusually short stay. 
All I can now Say, in addition to my numerous late advises which are 
at great length, e*, that I am now preparing communications for the 
Secy, of State direct^ made in virtue of my appointment^ as I antici- 
pate that the period is near at hand, when I can do this to advantage, 
as my other movements are, or soon will be, completed. 

The Govmt. Still appear to adhere to their apparent old plan of 
preparing an Expedition, nominally against Texas, but not with a 
View of ever carrying the new invasion into effect. Their real plan 
is, I am induced to believe^ as follows: obtain the means and authori- 
zation from Congress to raise an army of 10.000 Men (they have only 
about 5000 now^ all told) to place them on, or near, the frontiers, and 
then negotiate as they think, to greater advantage, and they expect 
that Congress will give them the double powers (Politico-Militares) 
for this purpose. This is the real object of Govmt. tho' it will only 
be avowed to some, while others, will be made to believe that the 
Govmt are in earnest in their Views of Restoring Texas to the 
National Union. They (the Govt.) and all those enlightened on the 
subject are fully satisfied they can never reconquer Texas. But the 
Govmt. being weak and tottering (and will be more so, if Canales 
should gain the Victory over the Govmt. Troops at Monterey or 
Matamoras, as some anticipate) adopt this mode of Gaining strength ; 
that is, assume the Texas expedition as their real object, when it is 
only the pretext, and the best, if not the only one, they can ruyw 
adopt to produce the desired effect on the Chambers. Congress were 
again in Secret Session Saturday on the subject of Texas, but as it 
has rained all Day I have not yet heard the result. 

As soon as I make my first communication to the Secy of State, 
I will transmit you a copy, and keep you regularly advised of what- 
ever may succeed. I am also preparing an Exposition, which If I 
gain a Conference or Succeed in opening a communication with the 
Govmt. I m/iy present. In preference to making a Verbal Expose of 
this paper, you shall also have a copy in due time. 

The position of the Govmt and of parties and of the frontier is 
embarrassing, and render it truly difficult for the Govmt. to act 
without Exposure to the attacks of the opposition and of the public. 
They mm/ be placed in a position where they cannot act at aU with- 
out exposing their places in office ; and Love of ofifice here is so much 
stronger than Love of Country, they may not be willing to listen at 
^Z;.__Still, I cwrmot think they will refuse me an interview or a con- 
ference under all the circumstances of the case. I shall have this

[Duplicate. "Confidential/'] 

Mexico, January 18th. I84O. 
My dear Sir 

I have the honor to hand you herewith. Duplicates of my last 
three communications of 20th. and 31th. Decmiber and 7th. instant, 
to which I crave reference, should the originals not reach You in 
safety. These advices are not very important, but I transmit copies 
to keep up the chain of events, and I should not have been silent 
since my last respects of 7th inst but for indisposition, (which has 
been but temporary) want of anything decisive to advise You and 
also want of opportunity to transmit my advices from the Coast. 
Even this dispatch goes to Vera Cruz, (and I think I will forward 
duplicate via Tampico) without knowing any vessel bound either to 
New Orleans or Havana; it must therefore take its chance thro the 
medium of my active correspondents. 

As regards the action of Congress in relation to Texan affairs since 
my last details, it will be suflScient to remark, briefly, and without 
occupying too much space: In relation to the project of Govmt., 
asking for Ways and means and extra powers politico-ndlitares, it 
has been under discussion, and still is; but in its original shape, or 
with a few unimportant amendments, it is of but little importance 
to the Govmt. or to my interests, except as regards the powers; for 
the Ways and Means, altho' granted, as reported by the Committee, 
is, as it were, a nullity, as it proposes a capitation tax, difficult to 
carry into execution, and, if executed, very slow in its operation. 
And, 2dly. as regards the powers in question, there is now no objec- 
tion to their beeing given, as it may facilitate my action with the 
Govmt., when the time arrives for opening direct communications, as 
suggested in my last dispatch. Hence, the project may become a 
law, as it ceases to be a matter of so much moment as to induce any 
formal opposition, even were it likely the bill could be checked; 
which is not probable, as You will see in the course of this letter.

530 AMEBICAK HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

In relation to my movements and those of my friends, I have 
already indicated what results we promised ourselves, and which 
then appeared reasonable enough, considering the state of things 
as they existed at the time. And altho' we have not entirely suc- 
ceeded as regards a Majority, yet there is a very respectable minority 
in the house, and perhaps a majority in the Senate (or nearly so) 
who are opposed to the expenditure of more money in the project of 
invading Texas, and who would, and will, co-operate with the Govmt. 
(when the time arrived for them to act) in an amicable arrangement 
of this question. This advantage, therefore, has resulted, not only 
in, and among the members of Congress, but among many influential 
and intelligent men, in and out of office and of both parties, vis. 
They have listened to the subject, examined it in its various bearings, 
reflected upon it, in reference to its effects upon the interests of the 
country, and they have almost universally come to the conclusion 
that a compromise of this question must sooner or later take place; 
and many think that now is the propitious moment, when it might, 
and in fact ought to be accomplished. 

The effects of thus moving and discussing this question in the Way, 
I have described (a matter of course and quite natural, while the 
Ck)vmt. are pressing the topic on the attention of Congress) has 
further extended to the conductors of the Press, many of whom have 
emitted opinions, not on the direct question, but significant and in- 
dicative, that the Govmt. should reflect well on the subject before 
subjecting the Nation to the unfortunate results of an other fruitless 
expedition against Texas. These and similar demonstrations of Ihe 
current of public opinion are not without manifest advantages, for 
they are calculated and were intended to produce an impression on 
the Govmt. itself, at a proper time; and, in case future hostilities 
should ensue, (initiated by either party) the war would be decidedly 
unpopular, with the intelligent people here, and therefore inefficient 
and abortive in its results on the part of Mexico. I have adverted 
to, and I think, sent an other initiative of Govmt. declaring it treason 
to speak or write in favor of the dismemberment of the Mexican 
territory and the views of the Texians etc,*» directed against Texas, 
but also intended to meet and prevent the agitation of Canales or 
Anaya's ^ plan of forming a northern confederacy. If this law passes 
now under discussion in the House, the acts of the Govmt will no 
longer be criticized so severely by the public and the press, and they 
can carry out their plans without the manifestation of so much oppo- 
sition. It is thought that this law will pass the House, but in the 
Senate its fate is more doubtful, tho even there it may find a 
majority.

Again, apparently not satisfied with this Texas Gag Law^ tne 
official organ has, for several days, been writing at length on the sub- 
ject of the liberty of the press, of rather its abuses, and has announced 
the intention of Grovmt. to ask Congress to abridge the present too 
great liberty of the press, proposing certain restrictions, which, they 
say, will conciliate the two extremes of liberty and licentiousness. 
The iniciative has not been sent in to Congress, but it is in course of 
preparation by Govmt. Ahnost every paper (and I am told by a 
member of Congress, that every one, except the o-fjicial^ which is 
salaried, of course) is opposed to the present Administration on 
some of the leading topics which agitate the Country, or on general 
principles. No wonder, then, that the Govmt desire exemption 
from the criticisms of so many Missiles that they may adopt and 
carry out their measures more quietly, secretly, and with less expo- 
sure. All this additional power and exemption from public scrutiny, 
however ill it may argue for the rights and liberty of the people, 
may come in play in favour of the views of Texas, whenever I can 
bring the question home to the deliberation and action of the Gvmt, 
I do not say that this is the object of these measures (I wish it was) 
but I only intimate that imder some circumstances they would 
prove favourable to my plans and objects. I will here remark that, 
during the Holidays of the New Year, there was much talk about 
a political Movement in this city, or what is usually called a pro- 
nunciamiento in favour of Federation, which, I have no doubt, gave 
the Govmt. some uneasiness. Whether this was to depend upon the 
success of Canales, or upon some movement upon the part of Sr. 
Anna, I know not, but it is now deferr'd, probably until some more 
favourable moment. 

It was about the same time currently reported and believed thai 
some movement was also contemplated intended to bring forward 
St. Anna again, and place him at the head of affairs. He was sud- 
denly taken ill, and his physician advised him to change his climate 
for that of Tacubaya ; and was more than once reported, on this way, 
up to the city. He has since asked for his passports for Columbia, 
which have been promptly granted by the Govmt. etc; but this is 
merely one of his Rtcse de Guerre^ to feel the public pulse ; as it is 
believed, he has no idea of leaving the country at all. This also 
served as an annoyance to the Govmt., and perhaps further induced 
them to adopt the measures already refered to in order to secure 
themselves in their posts. They are now apparently relieved from 
these immediate apprehensions, and emboldened, probably by the 
defeat (as they call it) of Canales, or his non success at the outset, 
and having, as I apprehend, recently been successful in gaining over 
to the support of Govmt. and its measures some doubtful members 
of Congress, they appear disposed to curtail the liberty of the press,

and abridge the rights and privileges of the people, the latter to 
resist any change that may thereafter be attempted, as above inti- 
mated. As regards Canales, the Govmt. have reed, and published 
official advises of his defeat, which is stated to be a serious one ; but 
it is not credited in general. Doubtless there has been a skirmishing 
and some loss, and Canales has retreated, but was not pursued. The 
(ruth of this affair remains to be told ; but there is no doubt that the 
Gvmt. forces, destined to meet him, are superior in numbers, and 
amply sufficieYit to keep him in check, probably for some time to 
come. An other topic has recently been started here, and doubtless 
will have some bearing (perhaps an important one) on the T's« 
question ; which I will refer to, that You may have a full view of the 
general state of things, as my object is to throw all the light I can on 
my own future prospects, yet^ I regret to say, in doubt. The Presidt. 
in his message to Congress expresses Surprizg^ at th Q ftpJm nwlpdgftnnftnt. 
of your Independence on the part of France ; and it has excited con- 
siderable conversation. It is now thought that this Govmt. will 
avail of this act of the french govmt as a pretext for not carrying 
out the pending stipulations of their late treaty, and that new difficul- 
ties may possibly ensue between the two powers. A call has already 
been made in the Senate for the production of the french treaty, which 
has not been presented to congress, nor has it been published. The 
opposition press in France oppose the treaty of Recognition of Texas, 
on the ground that it will give offence to Mexico and place in jeopardy 
the french commercial interests here, which, they say, are really more 
important than those acquired from Texas by recognition. This 
Govmt. [are] thus furnished with arguments to suit the purposes, if 
they are unwise enough, to carry forward the plan, as they now seem 
at least inclined to do. The new french Minister is expected dayly, 
and has been for some time. The call for the french treaty in the 
Senate will also bring out the Texas question, in that body, and will 
be availed of, incidentally^ for that purpose by those in favour of an 
arrangement with Texas. As regards the fact (which I informed 
you I had under investigation) whether there was any, and if any, 
what conditions giving to the bond holders any lien, or hypothecation 
of lands in Texas, or the proceeds of sale, or session ; I have to observe 
that the result of my information is not complete. The facts ascer- 
tained are these: Congress authorized the Govmt (Executive) to 
close the arrangement as they might think proper. Govmt. sent for-

No publicity was here given to the conditions of the arrangement, 
and hence the diflSculty of ascertaining under what stipulations the 
Matter was finally closed. I have however further ascertained from 
a good Source, that this Govmt reserved itself on the question at 
issue, at the time they acted on the Subject as above. Whether 
they have since ceded the question, or the reserved point, or refused 
it, or whether, without waiting for any decision on this head, the 
bond holders closed under the remaining stipulations, remain to be 
ascertained; but I am advised that the arrangement was concluded 
in London between the parties, some time in September, and the 
fact published on change on the 1th. Octbr. The Engl, packet, now 
due, and which will bring us London dates to 15th. November, will 
bring the whole arrangement, which they would publish forthwith ; 
and I shall then know precisely how the Matter Stands, as I con- 
sider it important, and [it] may have some bearing^ as regards my 
interview with Mr. Packenham. With Mr. Ellis, the Am, Minister^ 
I am on friendly, and visiting terms; but not a word has passed 
between us on the subject of my visit here. I am Satisfied that he 
will not open the topic, and as I am also convinced that no good 
would result from my broaching the matter to him, I have been, and 
probably shall continue to be entirely silent. He undoubtedly knows 
my objects here from letters transmitted him through me from Gea. 
Dunlap, one of which made known my character; but I infer that his 
own position, or the interests of his Gvmt, as regards the pending 
convention of indemnity, prevents him from acting in any way. 
Perhaps it is quite as well so as otherwise, since no good would prob- 
ably come from a different course, had it been adopted. I have stood 
aloof from Mr. Packenham since my last for the reasons already 
given you in my former communications; and also in the hope of 
receiving some advices and perhaps instructions from you touching 
this matter, and further in the expectation of knowing whether 
this Govmt. has yet accepted the mediation of England. 

My papers for the Secretary of State, as mentioned in my last, are 
now prepared for copying, and I only await the issue of some pend- 
ing matters which I consider may have an important bearing on the 
reception of my preliminary communication to present them. This 
will occur probably within a week, or ten days at farthest, when I 
will again write. I have thus given you, my dear Sir, a general 
synopsis of the state of things which now exist here, as near as I 
can ascertain them, all which altho' it may not be apparent at first 
view, have had, and still have an important bearing on my objects, 
and effect the measures I should adopt to secure all the possible 
chances of ulterior success. The obstacles have been, and still are, 
as You will readily infer, numerous; and I have delayed my direct

application, that they might be overcome or neutralized, either by 
time and circumstances, or by my own measures and efforts, and 
those of my friends here. In adopting this course, I have consid- 
ered it my best policy not to hazard too much by an immediate and 
direct movement, when the result would have been, probably, un- 
favorable, and the door might be closed against my final application ; 
but have deemed it more prudent and advantageous to the interests 
of Texas to prolong, for a short time at least, the uncertainty of my 
mission, while I could not lose any thing by the delay, but might 
greatly increase the probabilities of success. An other consideration 
of considerable magnitude has not been without its due weight, viz. 
expected communications from your Govmt., which I have been 
anxiously looking for during several weeks past: for, considering 
the return to the seat of Gvmt. of (Jen. Hamilton and Henderson, 
and also, since (I suppose) of Mr. Birnley, the opening of your Con- 
gress (and ere this, the close probably of the Session) the knowledge 
on the part of the Executive of the exact position of things in Europe 
as regards Texas, and the prospects of effecting the loan, all whidi 
will appear by the full and ample reports of your agents; I say, 
considering all these circumstances, I have thought myself justified 
in expecting from Govt, advices communicating a change of its 
views, if any had taken place, or confirming its wishes and instruc- 
tions as given me So long since as August last ; and more especially, 
since Gren. Hamilton's advices, as communicated to me from New 
Orleans, and before adverted to, recommend a course not contem- 
plated by Gvmt. when I recived its commands, and therefore not 
provided for in my instructions, viz. to Secure, by all means, the 
Mediation of Gt Britain, even without any detailed stipulations, and 
negotiate the arrangement in London. It cannot be doubted but Gl 
Hamilton had what he deemed good and sufficient reasons for his 
urgent request or recommendation, and would place his views before 
the Govmt. I have therefore considered that beyond all question, 
I should be advised and instructed in in relation to this branch 
of my duty. 

It is now 60 days since Gel. H. left N. Orleans, and 30 days since 
he expected to be in N. O. on his way north, and our latest dates now 
from New Orleans direct are 60 days old, so that it seems to me, at 
least, impossible that I should not have despatches from you on the 
way ; and they must be near at hand. These I have been, and still 
continue to be very anxious to receive, as they may, and almost 
necessarily must, throw Some light on the Subject by the further 
views of Gvmt. or by a confirmation of their former wishes and in- 
structions. Agazuj advices from Govmt. would, so far, apprise me of 
the condition of things, that I should at least know whether the 
position of the country or policy of Govmt was such that I should

best consult its wishes and interests by procrastinating a final issue, 
while the question could be kept open, or by accelerating a decision 
at once. This would or might, depend on the present condition of 
things at home and abroad, and the ulterior policy of Gvmt, which 
may have undergone some change. I cannot anticipate these events, 
which are possible, as I am without any advises from the department 
of State since the postscript to my instructions « reed, in N. York, 
and my private Letters, are only to 8th. Novr. from Texas, and 18th. 
or 20th. of same Month from New Orleans. I however recollect how 
strongly Gen. H. advised and urged that I should hold on and not 
abandon my post, so long as I could retain it. Hence, another cause 
of doubt and perplexity, which, in conjunction with the various 
others, have had a tendency to delay direct action. 

You here have, Sir, all the data I can now furnish you, and from 
it You will be able to form your own opinion of the probable result 
These details, or rather the summing up of my present position, is 
now given, as much to rectify any opinions or impressions I may have 
given you in my previous advices calculated to induce erroneous con- 
clusions on your part, as to place every thing in its true light, for 
your information and Govmt. 

My object has already been, and is now, to give you the in- 
formation I acquire, and my views and movements with due regard 
to the facts as I can best ascertain them and their legitimate infer- 
ences; but with all my precautions, discrepancies will occur, and more 
particularly in this country and on so delicate a topic, where every- 
thing almost comes through other channels, and it is always to be 
weighed and sifted very Scrupulously. Hence errors of opinion must 
inevitably occur. It has not been my object in this letter to justify 
the course / have pursued thus far, but, should it be thought that I 
have delayed too long my direct intercourse with the Gvmt., the facts 
and statements contained in this letter may serve, if not for my 
justification, at least to induce a suspension of such oppinions until 
I can clear up this point more fully (and which I trust I can do 
satisfactorily) but only on personal interview. I shall continue my 
frequent advices, and if they are retarded for want of communica- 
tion with N. Orleans or Havana as heretofore, I shall much regret it, 
tho' the remedy is not within my reach. Pardon the extreme length 
of this despatch (quite too long and tedious, I fear) and attribute it 
to my extreme anxiety to keep you fully and even minutely advised 
of every thing of moment which occurs here and effects the important 
matter conmiitted to my management. I regrett very much the ab- 
sence of advices from Govmt. and hope soon to receive them. I 
beg you will excuse any want of clearness in the matter of this let- 
ter, and also its execution. It has been written while indisposed, and

My dear Sir. 

I last had this pleasure under date of 18th. inst. with P. S of 20th 
to which I beg reference, tho' you will find it long and tedious. 1

tTien situated J or rather how^ many obstacles I had,^o remove or over- 
come. It is Stated (and I have been so informed specially by a 
friend) that the Spanish Minister ^ possesses great influence with this 
Govmt. and that I cannot succeed without his concurrence or co-op- 
eration. This gentleman, Senor Calderon de la Barca, was recently 
the Representative of Spain in the U. States and arrived here about 
a month since from the Havana via. N. York, and was received with

uivustuil honors. This great influence may he true in some degree; 
probably not to the Extent above^ Stated. 

Gen. St. Anna also may stand in the way of a recognition, as he 
may, Should he hear, that the Govmt. are in treaty on this subject, 
cause something to appear in some of his devoted prints which may 
frighten the President and his Cabinet, now easily alarmed at any 
thing from this quarter. This difficulty, I might perhaps overcome, 
If entire confidence could be placed in his friend here, who is Gene- 
ral Tomelj but he is looked upon by the Govmt. with as much jeal- 
ovsy as his master. Tomel has called on me and tenderd. his services 
very Especialy, but I have not returned his call, as the Secy of State 
or Almonte would, if they knew it, draw Such inferences aswould 
operate against my negotiations. I mxiy see him very privately here- 
after^ and if needful I will do so. 

^ Since my last, I have been informd. from a good Source that, as 
soon as the French Minister arrives, the present Charge, d' Affaires, 
Mr. De Lisle, will leave in a Brig of War, now under his orders at 
V. Cruz, and which was sent by the Commodore of the Havana Sta- 
tion, and he is directed to call in, and see you, and will therefore pro- 
ceed henccy that is, from F. Cruz, direct for Galveston. When Mr. De 
Lisle will leave, will depend on the arrival of his successor. I will 
write by him, of course and send a file of papers. Please consider 
this as confidential. I have now made all my preliminary movements 
and taken all the precautions deemed necessary, and to morrow I 
anticipate that I shall be informed by the Secy, of State that I can 
address him my preliminary communication announcing my arrival 
and my character, and soliciting an audience. 

So that I feel as if I was on the point of gaining the first step; 
which at one m^oment I even thought doubtful. I may have to go 
through the introduction, perhaps intervention, of Mr. Pakenham; 
which of course I will accede to, if it comes in that shape, though, had 
I my choice, I would go alone. I think now I am certain to get the 
ear of Canedo, Secy of State; and itso, I am satisfied that, while I 
must be Very circumspect officially, I can say any thing I wish to him 
as Ccmedo, for altho' I have not yet seen him, I am sure I shall find 
him very friendly courteous, and frank personally with me. I wish 
I could say as much in regard to Sr. Almonte. I fear lie will be 
against me. But rest assured, my dear Sir, when I once get started, 
I will make the m^st of my position.

Evening, 
Sir. 

Referring to my last respects of 22d. and which, have gone for- 
ward, I am now happy to have learned by last Evening's post that 
the Erie will not Sail until the 5th Proxo. and hence tJus will reach 
her, and accompany my preceding two despatches and Several dupli- 
cates which have been awaiting at V. Cruz an opportunity to go for- 
ward, and after some delay will now find a good one pr U. S. Ship 
Erie^ which Vessel will stop off Balize. 

As I anticipated in my last on the 24th inst/ I sent forward the 
perliminary comrwunication as stated in my last ; but, in consequence 
of Some remarks, from Mr. Caiiedo to my friend this letter was not 
delivered, but returned to me next day with a suggestion that while 
the matteVy was unohjectiondble^ it would be better policy to modify 
the style and phraseology, and that the despatch should come through 
Mr. Pakenham, who had already profferd his good offices to the 
Govmt. in behalf of his Sovereigns, — to (dl which I assented, con- 
sidering them quite unessential in point of fact^ and knowing how 
very sensitive these people are, and more so on such a delicate topic 
as the one in question is at the present moment. Retaining the Sub- 
stance, I altered the Style, etc. to remove the objections of some of the 
Cabinet more nice than wise^ and to gratify the President. Mr. Paken-

munication, which I well knew would produce to a certain Extent 
the Same effect as if the Maiter was contained in the oificial note. 
And after two interviews with Mr. Pakenham, who had previously, 
and repeatedly^ Seen Mr. Caiiedo on the Subject, Mr P. delivered the 
despatch, three^ days since, when the Secretary of State informed Mr 
P. that He would advise me thro him, Mr. P. when he would receive 
me, the question of reception or seeing me and hearing me having 
been previously determined upon. From this period until this Even- 
ing^ I Saw Mr. P. twice, and he once calld. on me, but being out he 
left his card. The Secy of State has now informed Mr P that he is 
instructed by the President to say to Me through Mr P that he will 
see me at the Departmt of State tomorrow at 1. o'clk. where I shall 
of course attend tho not well, in Company with Mr P. If possible, 
tho, I fear it will n/)t be. I will send you copies of the Notes above 
referrd. to tomorrow^ as this letter must be prepared tomorrow 
Night to reach the Erie. 

Note In consequence of misplacing my Copying papers, I must 
copy this page in Ink. I have an impression in my Book, but not 
on the Sheet for transmission — ^this is the short remedy. 

It would be useless, at this moment, to give you the details of the 
conversations had with Mr Packenham, and those between my 
friend and the Secretary of State, altho' not without interest; inas- 
much as it is all of a preliminary and somewhat general character, 
and Even the most important items I can hardly qualify, or State 
what importance should he attached to them, until I get hold of 
Something myself direct. Besides, I have not time nor Strength to 
do the subject ample justice by this conveyance. I trust therefore, 
that your Excellency will be satisfied with the leading facts. By 
the neirt; oppty I will give you if possible the copies and such points 
as may be necessary for matter to be clearly understood. I should 
not have the proposed in^^rview to morrow, had I not specially de- 
sired it of the Secy of State thro' Mr P. on the ground that I had an 
opportunity by tomorros^s post to place letters in Vera Cruz in time 
for the Erie, and Mr. Caiiedo has thus indulged me, otherwise it 
would have been deferrd. until Next Week. 

This so far shows that Mr. Caiiedo is courteous to me at least. He 
also sent me an apology for not calling to see me, which, under the 
eidsting circumstances, I must overlook. So much for Mexican 
(Castillan) politeness.

terrupted conversation with Mr Caiiedo until half past 2 o elk. Mr. 
Canedo, made me quite at home and at once personally^ and gave me 
a long detail of his position in the Cabinet, its construction, prin- 
ciples, of action State of public opinion, difficulties in the way of 
rapid progress in anything^ and advert to the obstacles which he 
had found with the President and his colleagues, as regards the 
matter and manner of my reception, and he had, by using Mr. Pack- 
enham on the one hand, and arguing in favour of receiving and hear 
ing me confidentially,* and he was finally authorized by the President 
to listen to all I might have to Say, without saying much directly to 
the point. It seems that he as well as myself had, intended this as 
rather an introductory interview^ to open the way, gain my confi- 
dence, and give me some hints which he thought would be useful, 
and in which I had anticipated^ him. He was disposed to hear me, 
but, I suggested that my lungs would not, at the moment, permit me 
to Speak ai lengthy and that if he had no objection, I would pla/:e 
on paper the Views Sentiments, and wishes of the Govmt., as regards 
Mexico, which would be perhaps so far preferable to a verbal State- 
ment, that, if he found anything worth shewing to his colleagues 
and the President, he would have it in a Shape to Exhibit — to all 
which he assented. In this I had my objects and which I will not 
now detain You to Explain. He said however, he would see my 
credentials^ that he might report to the President briefly the general 
and introductory interview. I had in my pocket my instructions and 
the subsequent letter of the Secy of State and Explained that I had 
brought no credential Separate and independent of my instruc- 
tions — that I received orders from the President at Galveston, where 
a part of the Cabinet then were, but that the Seals of office being at 
Houston, and my departure urgent, the instructions had been thought 
sufficient, etc. etc. 

I Then shewed the introductory paragraph of my instructions 
relating to my appointment Exclusively^ and Shewed the Signature 
of Judge Burnet, Acting Secy, of State, remarking that the hand- 
writing of both papers, was entirely in that of the Judge, and I pre- 
sumed was well known to Mr Almonte, etc. etc. He seemed quite 
satisfied himself^ but stated that he knew the President would n^t be, 
and feared Almonte would object. He said that the Seal of State, 
in proof of the Signature gave validity to ones powers^ and Should 
according to all usuage be Separate and full for the objects intended, 
and that doucument alone would justify or authorize a discussion. I 
was obliged to admit the fact^ obvious enough, no doubt, but sug- 
gested Various Ways of correcting the Evil, so that no time Should 
be lost. He seemed willing to overcome the difficulty, so far as he

could, and promised to Endeavor to do the same as regards the Presi- 
dent and his colleagues, but could not positively prorrme on this 
point, as regards others. 

With Mr Pakenhams aid, I Can Manage this so as not to interfere 
with my progress in carrying forward the discussion to a point 
Verbally and by presenting the written paper referrd to. But, 
whether I shall reach a point where anything is to be signed or not is 
more than I can Venture to assert, nor can I say with certainty, 
whether the remedies proposed and listend. to favourably, by Mr. 
Canedo will be Satisfactory to the President and Cabinet, or whether 
Mr. Pakenham will feel disposed to help me thro' this difficulty, or 
not, as I have not seen Mr P. since my leaving the Palace. However, 
any or all these may result it appears obvious that it is best at once to 
forward Me a regular credential Signed by the President, and hav- 
ing the Seal ofthe Eepublic, and countersigned bythe Secy of State 
with the Seal of the State Dept.^ if any there be. This credential in 
the usual form will authorize me to enter into any permanent or 
preliminary arrangement with the Govmt. of of Mexico establishing 
the basis, or principles of a Treaty of Peace, limits^ recognition^ and 
soforth, according to instructions etc etc. This Should come for- 
ward original and duplica^tCj addressd. simply to Me and covered to 
M. Burrough Esqr. United States Consul, Vera Cruz^ and let one 
followthe other. If I accomplish anything, this will enable me to 
Sign^ and hind the Govmt. etc. If it is not wanted, I will direct its 
return. Should, as I take it for granted, you concur in this, let no 
time be lost in forwarding them. Should I remove the difficulty so 
far as to enable me to go on, I will advise you in a few days, when I 
am just informed there will be a/nother vessel from Vera Cruz to New 
Orleans. Should the Labour thus involved be in vain^ why, better 
so than lose am/ time from its delay. I beg leave again to Repeat 
that I think this should not be omitted asingle moment. One Copy 
might be directed via the Havanna under cover to some one there, 
to be forwarded pr. first good Vessel for Vera Cruz — the other by 
the -first vessel direct from N. O for Vera Cruz — if two different di- 
rect opportunities offer, they may of course be embraced. 

I said just enough to Mr. Canedo on the subject of business^ to in- 
duce a desire to hear more and hence operate as an incentive to Mr. 
Canedo to hear me through, under the proposed remedies which I 
shall try on monday. 

I have not time for more, the Mail hour having nearly arrived. 
I will report further in a few days by the Vessel said to be going to 
N. O. in a week or ten days. 

Your will pardon Haste, as I have been obliged to write away from 
my own room, and with such materials, and in such manner as I best 
could. I think I will be listened to throughout by Mr C. and, if I

this govmt. and hov> far they are disposed to go, If they are pre- 
pared to act at all. I am without any thing from you, but I hope 
you will soon send me something. 

You will have seen Mr Pakenhams letter to Gen. Hamilton ere 
this, hv^ you must not take all his opinions for gospel, tho' in that 
he may be right. He appears willing to serve my objects but I 
think I discover a disposition to procrastinate^ which if confirmed I 
think I know the object, I shall continue to use his good offices, and 
endeavour to merit them by an apparent if not real corresponding

Evening. 
My dear Sir. 

I beg leave to refer you to my late respects of 7th. 18th. 22d. and 
31st. ulto. latter with post date of Ist. inst. all which, I think, will 
have got together at Vera Cruz, and will be forwarded to Pensacola 
pr. U. S. Ship Erie, to Sail as I am advised to morrow from V. Cruz. 
I have only Sent forward duplicates of my advices up to that of 7th. 
tdto. inclusive J the balance are now being copied, and will go forward 
soon. 

I also addressd. you Separately a few hasty lines under date of 
1st. inst., covering a Manuscript Copy in Spanish of the contract 
between the Bondholders in London and the Mexican Govmt. and 
their Agents, together with the decree of Congress in relation to the 
Subject, and will soon place in your hands the instructions of this 
Govmt. given in virtue of said Contract and law of Congress for the 
Govmt of the Agents in London. I again recommend to your atten- 
tion said papers, as you will find by the translations (which I had 
not time to give you) that they are worth your attention. I will 
endeavor in my next to give you my views of the Matter, and Shall 
perhaps know more on subject then than I do now, for altho the Eng- 
lish Packet has arrived I have not found these papers published, and 
their bearing on my negotiation is such, that I do not wish to call 
the attention of Mr Pakenham to the subject, nor that of the Secy of 
State, at least until I am certain how the matter stands. It will 
appear from the contract I have sent you, that ^5 Millions of Acres 
of Land in Texas is Specially hypothecated to the bond holders, 
and if sold, the proceeds to go to them. This is, in addition to 100 
millions, previously hypothecated generally for the same object. I

asked for in my last Should arrive^ or time Should Shew that I have 
no occasion to use them for the purpose of signing any arrangements. 
This being done^ I shall send in an Exposition of your views^ and the 
wishes of the Govmt of Texas. 

This paper I shall draw up, as near as may be in conformity with 
your instructions, and, Such as I think best calculated to awaken the 
feelings and excite the interests of Govmt I consider a written 
paper of this character decidedly preferable to a verbal relation of 
the grounds of your application for pea^e^ and the pacific views of 
your Govmt. As soon as I shall have sent it in, that is, by the next 
conveyance. You Shall have a Copy of it, and my other communica- 
tions to the Secretary. Mr Pakenham has treated me, thus far, with 
great attention and seems disposed to aid me all in his power. 

In fact, the more I see of him the better I like him, and my previous 
unfavourable impressions are in some considerable degree removed. 
When the Secretary Shall have sufficiently examined and weighed 
my Exposition I shall be prepared to submit to him propositions, 
should he signify a wish to receive them. I forgot, in My last to say 
that, aware of the influence of Mr. Almonte in the Cabinet Councils 
and with the President on this Topic particularly, I addressd. him 
a private and personal letter some days since, calculated to conciliate 
him in the disposal of this question, but as yet he has not replied to 
it, and has resented some indirect overtures which I have made to 
obtain a Verbal interview. He, I fear will strongly oppose my 
pretensions. But I will See if I cannot reach him thro' some other 
channel, if possible. I also omitted to Say that Lord Palmerston has 
directed Mr. Pakenham, to request a categorical reply to an Extract 
from the instructions given by the former to the latter, which was 
given long since to the secretary of State, in which Lord P — says 
clearly that they reccommend an amicable adjustment of this ques- 
tion, and intimites that, after a reasonable time, they shall do as they 
did in the case (similar) between Spain and Mexico — That is, recom- 
mend recognition If it is not done, England will follow her usual 
Laborious course and recognize. Whenever her interests require it. 
This is the Substance of the Note. They have only replied verbally 
and he will this week endeavor to get a More Specific answer. 

I have nothing further of interest but will write again within a 
week, and add all that may occur. 

Pardon my Scrawls, as my Copy book is bad. Hoping daily to 
hear from the Govmt, I Remain Very Cordially and truly, and with 
great consideration, in Haste Your Obt Servant

To Hon Barnard E Bee 
Sir, 

Since your departure the fate of our gallant Citizen Soldier Col 
Benjm H Johnson, and his party, has been ascertained. 

With a view to the more certain publication and general promulga- 
tion of the Presidents Proclamation "enjoining neutrality on the 
part of the Soldiers and Citizens of Texas, in the contest between 
the Government of Texas,<^ and the Federalists, on the west side of 
the Rio Grande, Col Johnson and his party had been despatched, 
that by his presence, the delusion, under which some of our citizens 
were laboring might be dispelled, and the policy of the President 
not compromited, by their misguided and imprudent zeal in taking 
a part against what they supposed to be the common enemy. It 
appears from the most authentic information, that we have been 
able to obtain that Colonel Johnson had executed the object of his 
mission, and left Carmago about the 15th Deer, last, and after 
crossing the Rio Grande on his way home, was intercepted, and 
the whole party, consisting of eight or ten persons, put to death with 
circumstances of fiendish cruelty, that could only be characteristic 
of the most uncivilized savages. 

It will be thus seen, that the good faith and moderation of the 
President, has been sealed, by the blood of some of our most worthy 
citizens, and a most gallant officer, who was surpassed by* none, for 
chivalry and patriotic devotion, to his Country's service. You will 
doubtless avail yourself of the circiunstances, attending the mission, 
and tragic fate of Col Johnson and his party, to impress on the 
Mexican Minister, and the Cabinet at Washington (with due delicacy 
however) this additional evidence of the moderation and humanity 
of our Government, 

A delicate regard for the Government of the United States*, whose 
friendly services as mediator had been so generously tendered, as well 
as a humane determination, not to extend the horrors of War be- 
yond the limit forced on us by necessity, and a prudent regard to 
our own safety, required forbid our Government taking part in the 
civil war, waging west of the Rio Grande. It must be obvious, that

until a pacification between our Gh>venimMit and the B^ublic of 
Mexico, every attempt of the latter to restrain the insurrectionary 
movements of the Federalists, will be wholly abortive; as the pro&- 
pect of a retreat on the east bank of the Bio Grande, in the event of 
failure, will always afford encouragement to a renewal of their ef- 
forts. This would be effectually and forever terminated by a treaty

Enter into^ when in our verbal interview he merely required what 
was called a Guarantee^ but only then required to be an official letter, 
Stating that He has seen satisfactory evidence that I was authorized 
to treat and hind the Govmt of Texas within my instructions. The 
paper now required of Mr Pakenham is unusual^ and he with some 
reason hesitates about giving it. 

We shall make another trial with Mr. Caiiedo, and endeavor to 
remove the difficulty so far as to go on with our conferences at leasts 
until the credentials are received. This may be a pretext to gain 
time or procrastinate^ but we shall see tomorrow or next day — at 
all events, you will perceive the necessity as I conceive that the Cre- 
dentials Should forthwith be sent in duplicate^ and let them be 
ample and full, that no further pretext or Excuse will avail tJiem, 
If by Tampico, My letters may be covered to E. Pakenham, the 
British Minister and forwarded to the British consul there — ^at Vera 
Cruz * as the department is already advised — Under cover to the Am 
consul. The very fact thxit they make the Excuse of want of formal 
credentials will compel them to h^ar and decide "When I get them, I 
therefore hope they will be sent without delay and in full form. I 
will address Mr Caiiedo a private personal note^ urging upon him 
to accept of Mr Pakenham's written assurance so that we may pro- 
gress in our discussions. 

Meantime, the documents referrd to arrive. I think we will over- 
come the difficulty somehow or other, if it has originated with the 
President and Almonte^ as I apprehend. But if it is a mere pretext 
to gain time they may compel me to wait imtil my powers come, 
which I hope will be very soon. I am pretty well satisfied now that 
Mr. Pakenham acts with m^, or honestly labors in my hehalf — of 
which I had hefore some Misgivings. If I find it best to press the 
matter upon the Govmt^ I can find ways and means to do so, but I 
think this would not be politic Mr Pakenham has letters today 
from Gren Hamilton which I shall see tomorrow.* I have nothing 
from any quarter I cannot say more, indeed, I write in great Haste 
fearing I shall miss this post.

[Prtvate.1 

Mexico Fehrury 7th. 181fi. 
Sir 

I have the honor to transmit you herewith copies of letters No. 1 
and 3,* which, which I have had occasion and intend hereafter, to 
address to H. E. Mr Canedo, Secretary of State in relation to the 
object of my mission, and I beg leave to submit a few remarks in 
relation to each communication, which I beg your Excellency will 
take into consideration, in perusing said letters, as without some 
Explanations, I fear, they might not be well understood, and perhap8 
they would not merit Y. E. approbation. I am aware Sir, that such 
papers Should Speak for^ and Explain themselves; but I trust that 
when Y. E. shall have received all my advices, up to the present date, 
you will be convinced, of the difficulty of my position, under the 
existing circumstances, and therefore, that to secure an interview^ and 
a full hearing^ was the only way in which I could carry out your 
instructions, or even learn anything of the Views and Intentions of 
this Government as Regards Texas. 

To Effect these objects, (without which my mission would be en- 
tirely abortive) I have had to bend somewhat to circumstances, under 
the direction given me^ and to adopt tha;t course which I thought 
best calculated to secure first the primary objects above indicated. 
Having already explained to you in former communications the 
causes of my delay in approaching the Govmt. and the course I 
adopted during this interval, I will now submit my letters, with such 
brief explanatory remarks as, I hope, will prevent any unfavourable 
impressions which the mere perusal of the letters might leave on the 
mind of Y. E. and I shall be happy ^ if in view of the whole subjecty 
I shall be so fortunate as to merit your full approbaticm, in the 
prosecution of my difficvU tctsk. 

No. 1. is a despatch I had prepared to announce my arrival and my 
character « here to the Secretary of State, as soon as I thought the way 
was prepared for its prohable favourable reception by Government* 
(The first clause requires no remark) . The second clause was framed 
under a full conviction thal^ unless I convinced the Govmt. that my 
character was entirely uriknown to the puhUc^ and might be so con^ 
tinned^ (if the Govmt. would keep their own secrets) I should not 
even obtain a hearing, and hence the importance I have attached to 
this point. The tJdrd clause I inserted because I feared the Secretary- 
might be willing to talk^ while he might be unwilling to write^ and

hence the entire option was given him, while, as you will perceive I 
wanted the opportunity of a conversation with the Minister, before 
any definite action was had by the Cabinet. In the fourth clause^ 
I was desirous to say something that would favourably incline the 
President and Ahru/nte to give me a hearing, as I knew they were 
both very obstinate on this Subject, and hence I made the formal 
assurance of Y. E. to the President of Mexo. of desire for Peace. 
The fifth clause^ requires no remark. The sixth cUmse was to account 
to Grovmt for my remaining so long here^ without presenting myself 
as I knew Ahnonte was aware of the day of my arrival here, and of 
course presumed that he had^ or rnigJU have informed his colleagues 
of the fact. 

This letter, having Submitted to my friend for perusal, I handed 
it to him for delivery to the Secretary, btU it was returned the next 
day unopened, with the opinion that it was not Such a letter as 
would please the President^ being too plain and categorical^ and not 
adulatory enough^ or smooth enough to suit these people, and might 
be fatal to my application for a conference; and after some reflection 
No 2 : was substituted. 

In regard to this letter No 2^ I have but little to say. You will at 
once perceive that it was framed to please^ and had only one leading 
object^ that of so far gratifying the President and Almonte as to 
authorize the Secretary to listen to me, and see what I had to say; 
and it produced the desired effect. In fact^ the said letter is a 
compound of Mexican IdeaSy put in Such English as I could best 
adapt to the case. The result, you know^ that I was admitted to an 
interview, and it was agreed tliat I should present in writing the 
views and wishes of Your Excellency, the only intermediate diffi- 
culty being that now under discussion between us, of the omission of 
formal credentials^ which, it was admitted, could be remedied by 
Mr. Pakenham ; it remains to be seen today whether we shall succeed, 
as Mr. P. has an interview with Mr. Caiiedo at 2 P. M. Your Ex- 
cellency will therefore make due allowance for this Document, No 
2; in view of this acclaration.^ As regards No. 3, containing the 
Views of Your Govmt which I have preferrd. committing to paper, 
that it might be seen and perused by the President and Cabinsty and 
perchance produce som^e effect; I hand it to Your Excy herewith, 
with som,e reluctaPMCy as it will shew how humhle has been the talenty 
which I have been able to bring to bear, on this Subject. I Sought 
to make it clear and intelligible and also Respectful^ and have en- 
deavored so to frame it, as to carry Some conviction to the minds of 
those whom I have to deal in this matter. I can hardly expect its 
Entire Approval^ but again claim for it Y. E's. indulgence and con-

Cmr or Mexico, January Hth. ISIfl. 
Most Excellent Sir : 

I have the honor to inform Your Excellency, that having been 
appointed by the President of the Republic of Texas Special and 
Confidential Agent of that Government to confer with the President 
of the Mexican Republic respecting existing differences, I am pre- 
pared to enter upon the fulfilment of the duties which devolve upon 
me whenever your Excellency will have the goodness to inform me of 
your readiness to receive me for this purpose. 

In the interim, I beg leave to observe to your Excellency, that my 
appointment to this confidential Agency, was intended to be Kept 
entirely Secret, and has been So Kept as far as practicable, for the 
. mutual convenience (as was Supposed) of both parties. I therefore 
respectfully suggest to Y. E. the expediency (Should his Excellency 
the President of Mexico concur) of still so considering it, until the 
result of my mission shall be devellopped, or, until the parties 
respectively may think proper to divulge it; and more especially, 
should the overtures which I shall have the honor to make (when 
admitted to a conference, on this important Subject) be entertained 
and acted upon by H. E., the President of Mexico. 

I leave entirely with your Excellency the manner of conducting 
this business, whether verbally or by correspondence; but, at the same 
time, I beg leave to suggest, as quite obvious, that a private interview 
between Your Excellency and myself may perhaps be the Most Con- 
ducive to a prompt and clear understanding of the Matter. Y. E. 
will, however decide on this point, as may appear most convenient. 

I trust I may so far further trespass on the time of Y. E. as to ful- 
fil, in this preliminary communication, one point of duty, and it may 
properly be considered the first. Permit me then, through Your 
Excellency, to inform His Excellency, the President of the Mexican 
Republic, that I am especially directed by the President of Texas to

assure EL E. that the President and Government of Texas most 
earnestly and Sincerely desire a peace with Meidco, and it is firmly 
believed by them that the time has now arrived when thM Peace 
should be secured^ with hanoc and advantage to both parties. 

When I shall have the honor of an interview, and of presenting to 
Y. E. the Views of the Government of Texas, I can enter into further 
particvlarSy which would be improper in this comimunication. 

If I have not sooner presented myself to Y. E. it has been becau^ 
I have be^i anxiously awaiting advices that would enable me to 
remove entirely any impressi(Mis or Suspicions which, the President of 
Mexico may have entertained^ as regards any knowledge or coopera- 
tion, on the part of the Government of Texas, either directly or in- 
directly ^ in the enlistment of some of its citizens or residents in the 
Banks of the forces recently in arms on your Northern Frontier.^* 

And altho I have not yet received these expected additional and 
unequivocal proofs^ I can however, assure Y. E. the President of 
Mexico, in the most solemn and positive manner, of the negative of 
these apprehensions, should any such still exist in the mind of His 
Excellency. 

Meanwhile, I resolved that, without further delay, it was my duty 
to announce myself, to Y. E. and shall be happy to furnish the proofs^ 
of the assurance I now give^ whenever I receive them. 

I await the satisfaction of Your Excellency's reply, to this confi- 
dential cammumcation^ as soon, as it may suit Y. E's. convenience. 

I have the hcmor, to be, with the highest regards and, consideration,

prejudices of men; and the welfare of all is duly weighed and 
Scrutinized, more with a View to the future^ than the present \ so that^ 
true Glory is now^ only Sought in those measures of pacific policy, 
dictated by the Superior lights of the present day. 

War itself has not now for its object devtrntatiorij as this motive is 
detested, even by those farthest removed from the scene of action, 
because in point of fact this would be to retrograde or, at least, sus- 
pend and retard civilization and the happiness of mankind. 

Texas believes herself entitled to general consideraticHi, because 
she is perfectly convinced of these salutary truths, and She cannot 
believe Mexico so unjust as to be governed by principles, which 
would eclipse the glory she has already acquired by her past acts, as 
well as the reputation for prudence and circumspection for whidi 
she is so much distinguished among the Nations of the late Spanish 
America's. 

In view of these convictiwis, in which it is gratifying to render 
due justice to Mexico, Texas despatched at the coimnencement of 
last Year An Agent to Mexico, for the purpose of establidiing a 
good understanding, between the two countries upon a rational and 
permanent basis, which would secure to each a friendly intercourse, 
and all the advantages of reciprocal commercial relations, together 
with those good feelings, which would present to the world the most 
flattering aspect. 

Texas might have adopted a different course, but she was unwill- 
ing thus, to resent her injuries, and, while she deplores the paft 
misfortunes of her people, she has the Satisfaction of not having 
abandoned those principles which in 1836 induced her to bury her 
griefs, rather than cause injuries to Mexico. 

Mexico had received abundant proofs during the preceding year 
of the pacific disposition of Texas, one of which was the observance 
of the most rigid neutrality in the Struggle between Mexico and 
France ; • and, notwithstanding this, Texas saw with regret its Agent 
rejected in a Manner so different from what might have been ex- 
pected, in view of the considerations she had manifested towards 
the Mother country. This, circumstance would have exonerated 
Texas in the estimation of the public from all responsibility, and 
justified her in acting independently in all her subsequent measures, 
without any further considerations towards a people who appeared 
to be, under the influence of unworthy motives and antipathies. 
Texas, notwithstanding all those circumstances, is disposed to satisfy 
fully her own principles, and is therefore, unwilling to run the slight- 
est risk of misconception, as regards the principles and feelings of the 
Mexican Government, which, perhaps, was prevented (on the occasion

both countries. 

The Undersigned, congratulates himself on having arrived in 
this Capital at a period when the Supreme 6ovmt. of Mexico has 
received the most positive assurances, as regards the impartiality of 
the conduct of Texas in the recent dissentions, which unfortunately 
have occurred in some of the Northern provinces, and he flatters 
himself that this circumstance in connection with various others, 
propitious to both countries will Secure a favourable reception to the 
request he has the honor to make to H. E., the Secretary of State

Independence of the loiter^ on the part of the former^ under Treaty 
Stipulations^ which Shall Secure a permanent pea/ce; a fixed hound-

intercourse between the two countries. 

In the first place, Texas, most sincerely and earnestly desires a 
peace with Mexico, which shall be lasting and honourable, as well as

554 AMEBICAN HI8T0BICAL ASSOCIATIOK. 

beneficial, to both parties; of which satisfact<»ry proofis mi^t be 
adduced, were they deemed necessary, And, 

In the Second place, Texas most fully and firmly believes that, in 
asking Mexico for a peace and recognition under Treaty provisi<ms 
She does not require of her any sacrifices, that will not be fully com- 
pensated for, by the benefits She will derive from the peaceful and 
friendly commercial Belati(xis which will grow out of these pacific 
measures of Policy. 

The following propositions, it is believed, will require no special 
evidence to Support thenL 

1st. That there is an entire dissimilarity in the educati(Hi, habits, 
dispositions, and pursuits of the inhabitants of the two Countries 
Which will forever prevent them from assimilating and moving har- 
moniously together under any system, were they again United. 

2d. That there is a total incompatibility of Ideas entertained by the 
people of the two countries as to those forms of Government best 
adapted to Secure the rights and provide for the wants of Society. 

3d. That conflicts would inevitably arise from this incompatibility 
of sentiments, and evils would indispensably result therefrom, should 
the Anglo-Saxon race now inhabiting Texas be again con-minded 
under the same form of Government with*a Mexican populaticm. 

4th. That Texas would be a possession, not only inconvenient, but 
almost worthless to Mexico from its remoteness from the Seat of Gov- 
ernment, and the main body of her population, as well also as from 
its contiguity to the United States, Where under any circumstances 
its intercourse must principally tend. 

5th. That Mexico would (obviously) experience great difficulties, 
and incur great expence, in keeping the Indians within and bordering 
on Texas in check, at so great a distance from its population and 
resources. 

6th. That there would necessarily result great benefit and advantage 
to both countries, from a friendly intercourse and Trade, conducted 
on the basis of Good Faith, and in the Spirit of kindness and har- 
mony. 

To the preceding, many other facts, equally self-evident, might be 
added; but these are deemed sufficient, for present purposes. 

In proof of the pacific policy of the Government of Texas, whose 
people entertain no feelings of antipathy against Mexico or her 
people, it may Suffice merely to refer to the disposition which Texas 
has constantly manifested, since the battle of San Jacinto, to rely 
on friendly negotiations in the adjustment of her differences with 
Mexico, rather than any further resort to War. 

Had Texas been disposed to adopt or encourage a hostile feeling 
towards Mexico, She has had inviting opportunities for invading that 
country, not only during the domestic conflicts by which from time

to time it has been harassed on the one hand, but also during the 
embarrassment produced by the French invasion on the other;** yet 
the Government of Texas has abstained from any hostile action, 
reposing confidence in its own aspirations for peace, through the 
medium of pacific measures of policy, towards the Mother country. 

If any confirmation of the continuation of this peaceful disposi- 
tion is wanted, it may be foimd in a very recent and highly creditable 
act of the President of that Republic, who rejected, or rather refused 
to entertain, propositions of Alliance or co-operation, made in the 
name, and behalf, of some of the Northern States, by the chiefs of 
a faction in arms against the Government of Mexico. 

Had the Govmt. of Texas been disposed to countenance these over- 
tures, it cannot be denied that Mexico would have been annoyed and 
embarrassed, by such a course, and thereby Exposed to considerable 
inconvenience and Expense. This forbearance, under such induce- 
ments and advantages, furnishes strong evidence of the earnest desire 
of Texas for amity, a desire which nothing will destroy, but an 
evident attempt on the part of Mexico to do her injustice and Wrong; 
and this injustice and wrong Texas is yet unwilling to expect at the 
hands of Mexico. 

If we look into the actual condition of the Young Republic, scarcely 
yet passed the threshold of its existence, we find it has been occupied 
from its earliest moments to the present period in forming and con- 
solidating her institutions and confirming her Political Government, 
until, as she herself now believes, she stands in a position, both as 
regards her internal and external situation, to justify her in the claim 
she now prefers on the parent Country for Recognition, and espe- 
cially, since Texas is willing on her part to make a liberal, and even 
generous sacrifice, by allowing a rational consideration for such an 
act of grace as Me2dco now has it in her power to bestow, by a 
prompt recognition, and a liberal boundary. 

If we merely take a glance, at the tranquility which prevails within 
her borders; the improvements every where taking place; her present, 
and rapidly increasing population ; the present state of her finances, 
and her future prospects, through the medium of her partially 
negotiated Loan ; her ability for self defence, consisting of a numer- 
ous body of Citizen Soldiers, at all times available, and a regular 
standing force, sufficient for any sudden emergency ; also, her Marine, 
which altho' small, consists, nevertheless, of some eight or ten efficient 
and well appointed Vessels of War, including 'an armed steamer; 
we should find many, if not all, the substantial elements of political 
stability, as well as self-defence. 

If we further examine her external relations, it will be found, 
that Since her recognition by the United States, (whose Government

has long since established, diplomatic relations and commercial inter- 
course with her, and is now engaged in running the line of demar- 
cation between the two countries, in conformity with the Treaty 
between Spain and the U. States) progress has also been made in secur- 
ing the advantages of an early intercourse, both diplomatic and com- 
mercial, with the first Maratime powers of Europe,** the result of 
which, so far as is yet known, is an established commercial intercourse 
between Great Britain and Texas, by which the flag and produc- 
tions of Texas, are received, and protected, in British Ports, the same, 
as Mexican ; * and more recently a Treaty of Re-cognition, Amity and 
Commerce, between the King of the French and Texas, founded upon 
principles of perfect re-ciprosity, and the consequent appointment of 
a French charg6 d'Affairs, near that Government. 

And it is furthermore believed that England will soon be disposed 
to adopt a similar course. Satisfied, as she probably is that the true 
interests of Mexico will be best promoted by a prompt and amicable 
arrangement with Texas. 

Numerous other facts, as well as arguments, might be further ad- 
duced, in confirmation of what has already been stated but it is 
thought entirely superfluous, inasmuch as Efis Excellency the Presi- 
dent of the Mexican Republic, as well as his constitutional advisers, 
must necessarily be very well acquainted with the true situation and 
exact condition of things, as regards the subject under Consideration, 
which, in every point of View, is important 

The principal advantages, which will result to both parties from 
this, much desired amicable arrangement, (besides the very im- 
portant considerations of Peace; boundaries; Treaty of Friendship 
and Commerce) will be those arising from an internal and Extemsd 
Trade between the two countries, both of which are as im'portant, 
(and probably more so) to Mexico, as to Texas itself. 

On the other hand, the renewal of active hostilities by either party, 
altho' its immediate consequences might not be feared or felt by 
either, would doubtless be productive of much evil, as it would. En- 
gender a Spirit of hostility, enmity, and revenge, which happily does 
not now exist, at least in Texas; and would inevitably tend to de- 
stroy and obliterate those friendly feelings, which ought ever to exist 
between a frontier population so extended as the one referred to. 

With right and proper feelings on the frontiers inculcated by the 
respective Governments, it would be easy to carry into effect, in good 
faith, such Treaty Stipulations as might be agreed upon ; while ex- 

• Up to the date of this letter. France was the only European power that had recognised 
Texas. The treaty with that nation was signed September 25, 1839. Ratifications, how- 
ever, were not exchanged till February 14, 1840. See Gammel, LawB of Texa; II, P. 655-

actly the reverse would be the fact, just in proportion as the frontier 
population became embittered by further hostilities. 

The alternative of War, whatever may be its final results, must be 
attended with great loss of Lives and Treasure, besides the numerous 
and unforeseen evils, which always follow in its train. 

As regards a passive war, that is^ a continuation of the present 
Statu Quo of affairs, it is diametrically opposed to the best interests 
of Texas, as she cannot remain in her present position without a 
greater sacrifice than she would be required to make, in any other 
attitude she might be called upon, or think proper, herself to assume. 

No course of policy, as regards the Parent country, was Specifi- 
cally pointed out by tiie preceding administration, or if adopted, was 
not acted upon. Under the Administration of General Lamar, this 
matter having been duly considered, a pacific policy was decided 
upon, in preference to the adoption of measures of hostility, under a 
full conviction that at a proper time and after due consideration, 
Mexico would meet these friendly views, as more consonant with the 
peaceful Spirit of the present age, as well as in accordance with her 
best interests, and hence apreciate these overtures of Texas, by accord- 
ing to her peace and Recognition. 

One effort has already been made by Texas to make known these 
amicable sentiments to the President and Government of Mexico; 
but from various unforeseen causes, which it is not proposed now to 
examine, this measure produced no result.** 

Unwilling, however to abandon the policy She has voluntarily 
adopted without first ascertaining the Views and disposition of (the 
Government of) Mexico, she has now adopted the present course, 
which, she believes, will be considered entirely unobjectionable, on 
the part of Mexico ; and she is at this moment awaiting the Issue with 
an interest proportional to the magnitude of the question of Peace or 
War and the length of time which has elapsed (to her great preju- 
dice) since she first marked out for herself this friendly course. 

She has now fulfilled a duty to herself, and performed a voluntary 
act of Justice towards her parent country, which she thinks should, 
and will, be appreciated by Mexico; and, in any event, meet the 
approbation of the friends of humanity, throughout the civilized 
World. 

It may be once more repeated that Texas is now waiting the 
result, with great confidence, that it will be Such as to enable her to 
Sheath the Sword, and henceforth become friends and neighbors with 
Mexico and her people. 

Should, however, Texas be disappointed in her hopes and expecta- 
tions of a friendly and honourable arrangement, she must, of course,

prepare herself, (if indeed, she is not already prepared) for the 
Alternative, and will thenceforward consider herself exonerated from 
all blame and responsibility, consequent upon the non-Success of this 
Second, (and probably the last) friendly overture to Mexico, for 
Peace and all its happy concomitants. 

To this hasty, and in many respects imperfect ExpoeS, other con- 
siderations might still be Super-added, and especially in reference 
to the uncontroulable evils which must result from renewed hostili- 
ties, which might be much prolonged ; but they are omitted, and will 
doubtless be properly understood and duly appreciated, by H. E 
the President of Mexico, as well as by those who may be called upon 
to deliberate with him, in relation to this important matter. 

The object of this statement has been to represent, in all good 
faith and with great frankness, the well known wishes of the Presi- 
dent of Texas, and the Views of that Government, and further to call 
the attention of H. E the President and Government of Mexico to 
this important subject, in all its various aspects and bearings, with a 
view to its early decision in relation thereto. 

This being accomplished, the preceding facts, inferences, argu- 
ments, and reasonings, are, with all due respect, submitted for such 
consideration and action, as His Excellency the President of the 
Kepublic may consider them justly entitled to. 

In fulfilling the high confidence which has been reposed in the 
Undersigned, by the President of Texas, it has been the primary ob- 
ject of the writer to transcribe faithfully the views of the Govern- 
ment of Texas, and at the Same time carefully to avoid everything 
that could, even in the Slightest degree offend the honor or the 
dignity of the Kepublic of Mexico, or its chief Magistrate and Gov- 
ernment; and he flatters himself that he has succeeded. 

If unhappily he should be deceived, he relies upon the kind in- 
dulgence of H E the President, as well as that of Y. E, to attribute 
it to inadvertence and the very Slender and humble talents with 
which the Undersigned, unfortunately, has been able to illustrate 
this highly important Topic. 

The Undersigned concludes by tendering his most respectful con- 
siderations and highest regard to H. E. the Secretary of State for 
foreign affairs, and through him to H. E. the President of the 
Mexican Republic.

Tbeat to Lamar.<» 

[Private.] 

Mexico, February 8th, ISIfi. 

SiK. 

I beg leave to refer you to my short and very hasty letter of the 1st. 
instant, covering a marmacript copy of the contract between the Eng- 
lish holders of Mexican Bonds, and this Government, and also, a copy 
of the Decree of Congress^ confirming the said contract, to which I 
then called your attention, and suggested that the document was well 
worth a translation and an examination. 

According to my promise, 1 now enclose you, the instructions 
given by the President in council to the Agents in London for their 
Government in carrying out the provisions of the contract and the 
decree of Congress which you will find comprises H articles, which 
complete the document. On a hasty perusal of the whole paper, the 
impression was clear on my mind that By the Contract, the Bond- 
holders of the. converted Stock had the General Cruarantee of 100,- 
OOOfiOO of acres of Lands, in the Departments, cited in the 7th. article 
of the Contract, first clause, and this Guarantee was to Secure the 
final total payment of the principal and interest of both classes of 
new stock; and in ca^e of sale, to be at $1.25 the acre, the proceeds 
to be paid to the Bondholders in Europe. This, I thought then was 
the obvious reading of the one Hundred Million clause. A more close 
examination, however, leads to a different conclusion or Literpreta- 
ticML The 100 millions, in some one or more of the departments 
named, care undoubtedly hypothecated, but any part, or the whole, in 
any one of these Departments may be dispo^ of ceded or sold, and 
the proceeds appropriated, as this Govmt pleases. So long as they 
h/ive 100 Millions of acres remaining, in any of the said Departments, 
the hypothecation is complete. Here, or there, are your, 100 MU- 
lions. This, interpretation can be given, whether intended originally 
or not, because no one department is named but five, in either of any 
of which the 100 Millions can be considered as located, for the 
Security of the Bondholders, and the benefit of same, in case the last 
100 Millions should be encroached upon. Again, in the Same Article 
7th of the Contract, in the Second clause; the 25,000,000 of acres are 
Expressly reserved, or Specially hypothecated, and to be fixed in a 
futwre decree of Congress, or Govmt. " in the Departmeryts, of easiest 
" communication with the Atlantic and best adapted to foreign Colo- 
^^nization. These said lands are espesially and exclusively appro- 
" priated to the Deferred or Passive bonds (being one half of the 
** whole debt, and which bear no interest for 10 years) in case the

^^ holders wish to Exchange the bonds for Lands, and if the Govmt. 
^ should SeU them (the i6 Millions) the proceeds should be appro- 
" priated to the redemption of tftese bonds." You will perceive that 
these 25,000,000, are to be located by a special and public decree. 
This is not yet given, and probably will not be, but should it, the 
Government have the option to fix the 25 millions, where they please 
in any of the Departments — ^it does not say any of the above named 
Departments, but in any of the Departments, viz. of the whole Repub- 
lic. It therefore appears, that no part of Texas proper nor any por- 
tion of Land East or North of the Rio Grande is absolutely hypoth- 
ecated to the bondholders, and of course they are not entitled to 
any proceeds arising from sale cession or transfer. This m^j^, or can 
be, the interpretation of this Govmt. if they please to do so. 

When persons present themselves here, with the deferrd. bonds 
and demarid a location, under the contract and Law Referd. to, 
then the Govmt mAist say where they are to go, or pass this Special 
order or decree. None have appeared yet that I know of, and it re- 
mains to be seen when they will. My impression is that the Govmt. 
had in view the Lands between the Nueces and Rio Grande, to locate 
the 25,000,000 or to place the settlers; how they will proceed now, or 
when the time arrives for them to act, I cannot say. Thus you have 
my views of the important claims of said documents, but if you 
have a careful and intelligent translator in the State Departm^ntj 
you will find the whole perhaps worth translating. All which is 
respectfully submitted. 

I remain with great respect and consideration, 
Your most obt and Hble St, 

James Treat.

other, not t^ii^important matters, hoping it may overtake my la^t of 
6th. inst. Should it not^ it will not probably be far behind those of 
my Letters which have gone to Pensacola, pr. U. S. Ship Erie^ nor 
those pr. O. C Kaymond, for N. Orleans^ as the Frances Amy is to 
sail for the laUer Port on the 12th inst I have already informed 
you that the simple ofjickil Note of the British Minister, assuring 
the Secretary of State that he was abundantly satisfied of the suffi- 
ciency of my powers and the validity of my instructions, would be 
sufficient to enable me to proceed, hut a positive, and more formed 
Gv4trarUee^ was required, than Mr Pakenham could give. But as 
Mr. Pakenham received by way of Tampico on the 6th. inst a long 
Irtter from Gen Hamilton dated at N. Orleans, 1st 2d. and 3d.*» inst. 
(rather January) in which I was referrd. to, and in which Gen. 
Hamilton, goes into some details, of the present views of your Govmt 
it was agreed that with this addiiion^X evidence Mr P should again 
call on Mr. Canedo, and make one more effort on this point. This 
interview was not effected until Yesterday, when a long conference 
took place and Mr. P. urged the consideration of the Matter strongly 
upon the Secretary : Stating that now was emphatically the time to 
listen to me, that there was no doubt but my powers and instructions 
were ample to discuss and treat, and that there could be no reasonable 
douht but th/zt my formal powers and credentials would be forthcom- 
ing, when I could sign any preliminary arrangement, or even a defini- 
tive one. Should we agree on anything in the meantime. The Secre- 
tary however, was fi,rm in his purpose, and required that the Guaran- 
tee^ full and formal^ as required, should be given, or the Subject Sus- 
pended until my credentials reached Mexico. This Mr P. on his 
part declined^ and gave his reasons to the Secretary, as he had pre- 
viously done to me. 

It was, however, agreed upon between us before the final call that. 
Should this be the result, Mr. P. Should Say, then let Mr Treats com- 
munications and final propositions be received through me and I 
will assume the responsibility of the correctness, of any proposals 
that he may make, Satisfied as I am or shall he^ when the case arrives^ 
that Mr. T. will not propose anything in which he is not justified by 
his instructions, and thus the Matter has been arranged^ and I pro- 
posed passing him a Note recognizing this arrangement, so that 
he shall not fiy from it. This shall be done on Monday, and on 
Tuesday I will present him the exposition of your views^ as I have 
drawn it up from the general tenor of your instructions, and what 
I know to be your wishes, and those of your Cabinet, on the General 
Subject. After this paper (which will purposely abstain from stat- 
ing anything from which your, or my, propositions can be inferred)

Shall have been disposed of by the Secretary and the Cabinet, and 
produced its effect, (whatever that may be), I shall then be prepared 
to submit my -first propositiona^ in view of which I diall probdbhi 
receive an answer of some Sort. If it be a decided and unequwocai 
refusal, which will not admit of any diseussicm of the different points 
involved, I can then ask if the Govmt have any counter propoHHons 
to make, to ^^ as fuUy as possible, what their views are in reality. 
That isj So far as this may serve to show them. In the meantime, 
I shall endeavour to learn through my private channels, if pracH- 
cahle^ their real and secret views j and intentions. 

This under all the circvmstances I have considered as my best 
course. It will Save Some time, if the Govmt. act promptly, and 
with the aid of Mr P I think the matter v^ come to som^ issue ere 
many weeks. Meanwhile, I take it for granted that you will send 
forward the credentials I have asked for in full and due form and 
without delay, as I have pledged myself to the Secretary as well as 
Mr Pakenham, they would be senti and this would give confidence 
to your views and wishes, for Peace and a final arrangement. Even 
though I should reach a negative more promptly than I desire or 
anticipate, and there should hence be a suspension of the Negotiation, 
I should make known the fact to the Govmt. that I had received my 
credentials^ and was ready to receive the final wishes of this Govmt. 
before my departure^ for Texas ^ which would be equivalent to re- 
opening the subject for further discussion or any change in their 
previous determinations. These however^ are merely my present 
views^ without any other instructions than those originally received. 
Mr. Pakenham has been very much occupied, ever since my first 
interview, and especially for several days pa>st^ so that my interviews 
have been Short, and our conversation confined to the immediate 
point at issue, or the subject very generally; but next week, I shall 
have a long and full conversation with him on all the points in- 
volved, and act then as may be deemed most advisable, in view of 
Mr. P'^. opinions. I also remark as Very obvious that I hope to re- 
ceive your further advices and commands, if any^ soon, indeed 
daily, — ^and at all events^ before the question comes to a prelimmary 
issue with the Secretary, under the course. I have herein condition- 
ally marked out as my probable course, subject to such modifica- 
tions as may grow out of a further and fuH conference with Mr. 
Pakenham and also subject to any variations that may arise from 
your further advices, which I await with great anxiety and almost 
impatience. 

I shall examine more closely both the letters from Gen. Hamilton 
to Mr. Pakenham particularly the last letter,* which, being written 

•The first, which was dated November 18, 1839, has not been found; for the second*

on his return from Texas Should be considered as in conformity 
with the views of Govmt. so recently ascertained by tiie Gteneral — but 
at the Same time I think I ought to anticipate your advices in con- 
formity with those of Gen. HL — ^if his views to Mr. P. are those 
entertained by yourself and Government. I shall await them, that w, 
your despatches, for my better Govmt. in the prosecution of the inter- 
est of Texas, as regards my correspondence with Mr. Canedo, and as 
regards the joint action of Mr. Pakenham and myself; or at least, to 
enable me to receive his advice and opinions, without the risk of run- 
ning counter to the wishes of Your Excellency, or the advantages of 
making the Most of our negotiations, at this mteresting period. Mr. 
Pakenham considered the letters from Gen H. satisfactory — that w, 
Mr. P. is satisfied that the views given him by Gen H are authorized, 
and in conformity with his powers or authority, but at the same time, 
they do not authorize Mr. P — to act authoritatively, for he can only 
say, if he desires it, or if we think it good policy for him to assume 
anything, as regards Mr. Canedo, and the negotiation which is now 
generally opened. I remark that in this case Mr P. can only say I 
am authorized by Gen. Hamilton to say, or do or pledge thus and so. 
The question may be put to Mr P. — and who is Gen H? We hnow 
nothing of him ; and that would be a case parcdel to my own, for they 
virtually say who is Mr. Treat? The answer is a confidential agent 
with powers to treat. They reply where are his credentials? The 
only difference is thM should they say this to Mr P, he might say I 
Guarantee this — So and So. This however he has declined, in my 
case. I make these remarks for the purpose of adding, wJiat I know 
would be gratifying to Mr. P and that is that the Department should 
address him direct and say to him what they desire him to do. This 
would relieve the difficulty entirely. Then his assertions and state- 
ments, would have their full and due weight with the Govmt. There 
are two courses which suggest themselves to my mind: one is that 
the instructions (in conformity with Gen. Hamilton's letters to Mr P. 
or otherwise, as Your Excellency may determine) shall come to me 
(should they not already be near at hand) and Mr Pakenham re- 
ceive a copy of them at the same time with your request thro' the 
State Department requesting his good offices in my behalf to carry 
out views And wishes, through to an issue and that Mr. P. be further 
requested, that if he can act in the premises more efficiently with this 
Govmt. than I can, in consequence of his official character and con- 
sequent influence, then he may consider the instructions given me as 
to him and he may act with my knowledge and concurrence, ( as we 
should not probably disagree). In this cases, if my credentials came, 
as I take it for granted they will, I do not see that they can in any 
way refuse to confer and treat with me directly^ and in this case I 
should always have the counsel and advice, opinion and co-operation

for the mattevj as well as manner^ of their contents and execution. 
With the copies^ I trust, they will be found intelligible. By my late 
advices, up to 8th inst it will be Seen how I then Stood with the 
Govmt. or the Secretary of State. It is now pretty obvious that the 
vaccinating course of the Secretary, and his determinations of one 
day, varied or changed the next, all have had their origin in the 
desire of this Gentleman to avoid any official contact with me^ as 
your recognized Agentj hence^ the notice taken of the omission of my 
credentials (altho' this was rather to have been anticipated under 
all the circumstances of the case) and hence^ after a^ssenting to the 
plan suggested of considering Mr. Pakenham's Letter, which as pro- 
posed would have been an official communication to the Secretary of 
State, assuring him that he Mr P. was entirely satisfied with the 
validity of my appointment, and that any thing I might propose 
within the limits of my instructions would, in his opinion^ be ratified 
by your Govmt., if adopted and ratified here. Whilst I was led to 
suppose th^ this assurance from Mr P. would be amply sufficient to 
relieve me from the want of my credentials^ until they should arrive, 
It resulted, at the next interview that the Secretary Seemed to expect 
that Mr. P. was prepared to bind his Govmt. to the ratification of any 
arrangement, all no doubt to avoid the responsibility of meeting me. 
A sort of arrangement was then proposed by Mr P. thoit my commu- 
nications, to the Secretary Should go through Mr. P. who would 
be responsible, or vouch for them, as we progressed, in the business. 
This latter arrangement had been previously arranged between Mr P. 
and myself, in case of necessity. 

Wishing to bind him to this arrangement before he should again 
change his mind, I addressed him a sh/yrt note (copy of which with 
others I will transmit in a few days) in which I expressd. my 
regret that the Guarantee required of Mr P. was not such as he 
thought he could with any propriety give, and assenting to his plan 
of receiving my written communications, promising him tfuit I would

we had verbally agreed upon etc. etc. 

On Mr. Pakenham's delivering the Secrftary this letter, he again, 
became unquiet^ and Said that Mr P. had misunderstood him, that 
communications signed by me (tho' simply with my name, and vyith- 
out any title of Agentj etc.) was what he wished to avoids as this 
would be to treat with me as agentj and altho' he was personally and 
individually satisfied of my appointment and powers, yet I had pre- 
sented no credentials which would justify him, as the organ of 
Govmt. to open a discussion with me^ on the apparent objects of my 
mission. But that he had intended to say, that Mr P. might hand 
him any paper or communication he pleased touching the matter at

issue, that he would receive it, and place it before the Govemmnt 
for their knowledge. The Secretary adding [that] these communi- 
cations of course will be without Mr. Treats signature, and I • shall 
receive them as prom Mr, Pakenha/m etc etc Nothwithstanding. 
all thia^ the Secretary retained my letter duly signed by me, and 
officially addressed to him as Sec^ of State; and on yesterday I 
handed Mr Pakenham my Exposition (essentially a copy of that 
sent you under date of 7th. inst. an exact c(^y of which I will send 
you^ in a few days,) but, that the Secretary should have no pretext 
for returning it, either before gc after personal perusal^ it was 
thought best that it should not be addre^ed offlciaUy to him, nor 
should it bear any signature at aU. 

Mr. P. [said that he] would present it yesterday or today ^ and we 
agreed that he should (the Secretary) be allowed Some days, for its 
examination and translation, before we again approached him on the 
subject, as it was desirable that it should [be] laid before the Presi- 
dent and Cabinet, and have their consideration and deliberation, 

Mr P. thought best to shew this Expose to the Secretary for the 
Home department, a man of intelligence and influence with Uie Presi- 
dent, before, handing it to the Secretary of State. I, shall not see 
Mr P. until tomorrow, to know what, if any thing, the Secretary may 
have said on its delivery. I take it for granted it will be received, 
but what effect it may produce, time must shew. 

Thus, Sir, I have given you the facts of the case, and how this very 
simple matter of approaching the Me2dcan Secretary has been pro- 
longed and twisted about, by the fears and apprehensions of a timid 
and vasciUating; (tho' Very gentlemanly) personage, at the head of 
foreign Affairs in Mexico. You can. Sir, draw your own inferences 
from the statement already given, but should perchance my opinion 
and version of the whole matter be esteemed of any value, I will give 
it to you. ' 

1st. The present Govmt. or Cabinet could not refuse to hear me in 
some way or other, for they had authorized Mr. P. before my arrival 
to say that if commissioners from Texas appeared, they should be 
heard. This, however, I only knew very recently, and besides this, 
they were no doubt apprdiensive of the consequences of any direct 
refusal to listen to me, coming to them Secretly. 

2d. They are nevertheless, afraid to have it known by the Public 
that they are entertaining the Subject of any arrangement with 
Texas, while they are endeavouring to raise money thro' Congress^ 
as th^y say, to reduce Texas to order; and the opposition and San- 
tana's * party would make a great hue and cry, and the members of 
the Cabinet might lose their places in consequence. In otJier words,

they are too weak as a government, to Stand any new shocks which 
might faU upon them if they were openly to favour an arrangement. 
8d: Consequently, while they are compelld., as it were^ to hear^ 
but are obliged to hear Secretly, the Secy, is obliged to Shield Mm- 
self and the President and Cabinet under Mr. Pakenham^s wings — 
so that If the Secret (at present) of my being here with powers to 
make proposals Should leak out, caid the Govmt. be called upon to 
say whaty if om/ thing, they have done in the Matter, they can Say 
they had nothing to do with the Agent, whose powers were not com- 
plete, but that Some overtures had been made by Mr. Pakenham^ to 
whom they were obliged to listen, as he had been directed by Lord 
Pahnerston to make mquiry as to what this Govmt. intended to do, 
etc, etc. and thus cover themselves from the effect which the opposi- 
tion would endeavor to produce against the present Ministry. 
Knowing this to be the dUenmui of the Govmt. I have been disposed 
to assent to every thing that has been required, and go for my first 
main object, that of placing before them Your Views, and compelling 
ihem thus to gvoe ear to your views and wishes. Of course, I would 
not, ^ under Such circumstances, stand upon any matter of form, 
whidx would stand in the way of a hearing of my case. So /or, then, 
I have succeeded^ in my first objects. In speaking of the Opposition 
party^ that is, the Leaders of the Federal party here^ opposing this 
administration in any amicable arrangement, You must not under- 
stand me to say they oppose the Texas question, or any part of it, on 
its merits; hut they stand ready to pounce upon every thing the 
Govmt do, to render it wnpopuLwr^ and endeavour to bring about a 
reactionj and they would of course, avail of this Teteas question^ if 
they could, to excite the popular feeling against the Ministry and 
President, and if possible, would hurl them from their places, while 
the moment they the liberals get Snugly in place, they would no 
doubt treat in earnest with Texas for Some arrangement. 1 am most 
th^oroughly satisfied that Gen. Bustamante and the whole of his Cabi- 
net are entirely convinced that they can never re-conquer Texas — 
and thatj so far as the good of the country is concerned their best 
policy would be to recognize at once. Settle all pending questions, 
and secure the indemnity now proposed. But, as the men in power 
are acting for themselves, and their continuance in office, and under 
party views and dictation, the present or future good of the Country, 
is the Secondary consideration, but not the first, by any means. The 
present administration is not very secure. They have been in power 
now six months, and, in my opinion, it would not be strange, if they 
did not complete this year. Yet there is no such thing as calculating 
in advance on a/ny thing. They are so changeable, and there is so 
much open corruption and demoralization in ciJl ra/nJcs of Society,

that mens opinions are anything hut fixed — ^they may be what you 
please today ^ and to-morrow converted, aM<m oOTrupted. 

Notwithstanding this unfavourable picture which does not look like 
a prompt or favourable result to my mission, I still hope that the 
convictions of the Grovermnt will be so strong in favour of some ar- 
rangement that they may yet venture to enter upon «om6 stipidations 
very secretly j and trust to their future increased strength some months 
hence^ to let them come to light. Some fevourable conjuncture may 
give them courage^ and if frightened a little on the score of Conse- 
quences, they may consent to do scHuething. 

As regards, the matter of the Bonds, and the real Stipulations be- 
tween the holders of the new stock and this Oovemment, I beg leave 
to refer You to my two Bespects of 1st and 8th. instant, hoth cover- 
ing the contract Law of Congress^ and the instructions of this Govern- 
ment, which, when you have them translated, together with my Ex- 
planatoiy remarks will be no doubt be well understood, by Yourself 
and Judge Burnet. 

In relation to Mr. Pakenham, I confirm all I have before said in 
favour of his good offices and valuable Services. He continues to 
desire to do all in his power to aid me in my plans, and to urge upon 
the Govmt. the necessity of adopting some course in regard to this 
business. He admits that of rig?it the Bondholders would have no 
claim to the indemnity which might be paid to Mexico for the in- 
dependence of Texas, but at the same time, would be m^st happy if 
he could obtain thds amount for them^ in case any arrangement is 
entered into, as contemplated by Texas. 

This, alone, would stimulate him, together with the credit he would 
acquire as Mediator or intervenior, in the Negotiation. But inde- 
pendent of these considerations, he really seems to be devoted to bring 
about Some favourable result to my ^mission, Mr. Pakenham and 
myself agree that to open any negotiation in London, or transfer to 
that city for conclusion, anything that may be corrvmenced here would 
be very bad policy, as it might, and probably would, procrastinate 
the negotiation almost ad-infinitum, particularly if this Grovmt. de- 
sired to prolong the Question and any change in the Govmt or even 
in the Ministry would require a renovation of powers, and, on any 
point, on which their Agent might not be fully instructed, he might, 
merely to gain time, wait for further orders, and thus the matter be 
kept open, until you should be tired of waiting for any result The 
Mediation of Mr P. is very well, and advantageous, here, and it is 
here, and at N. Orleans, where the matter should be hegun and fin- 
ished. Commence and fix upon a basis here; and let their Commis- 
sioner proceed to N. O. to fix any of the details, and exchange Batifi-

cations. This is decidedly the best course, in my opinion. Should 
I succeed in getting them to enter up<Hi any arrangement. All this, 
may be quite premature^ as we may never reach tJus point. 

But should we, you here have My opinion concurred in by Mr 
Pakenham. I must, however, bring my present remarks to a close, at 
least for this post^ altho' much more might be said. I trust, never- 
theless^ that I have said enough in this communication, together with 
my former, advices^ to shew you that I am devotedly and faithfully 
engaged in bringing about your wishes and desires, for the interests 
of Your Country, or at least to ascertain what^ if anything^ this 
Government is disposed and able to do. Whether I have proceeded, 
in the course I have thus far adopted judiciously or not I submit to 
your own better judgment. You will on receipt of this know exactly 
how matters how Stand. The chances are still much against my 
success, and still I have hopes of obtaining som^ thing — getting from 
them som^ propositions. I think a plan mdgfU be devised which 
would soon bring this Government to grant a peace and recognition, 
in Case they should now entirely refine to assent to any of Tour 
Propositions. I may submit this plan to your consideration at a 
future day, for whatever it may be worth. It might be considered 
as preferable to a mere armistice, if thai> should be ALL this Gov- 
emmeni is willing to propose. I trust that ere long I shall be 
further enlightened by your additional instructions rendered now 
not only very desirable^ but almost absolutely necessary, and Espe- 
cially if you have adopted the views communicated by Gen H. to 
Mr Pakenham as regards an armistice, until April 18il^ conditioned 
that this Govmt meantiTne agree to negotiate a peajce^ Recognition^ 
and boundaries. Pray, my dear Sir, give me your further and full 
views and wishes when you send my credentials, or if not dxyne 
already^ immediately on receipt of this. I have not had the full con- 
versation I promised myself with Mr. Pakenham, but shad next 
week, and will then report the result. I have not received a Texan 
newspaper or letter since my arrival here. 

I am most anxiously awaiting some arrival from N. Orleans at 
Vera Cruz — ^which I am sure must bring me something from you. I 
hope my request about funds will have m^t your sanction^ and that I 
shall soon be so apprised. 

I remain with great Bespect and consideration, Your obedient 
Servant,

[Confidential.] 

Mexico February 2Ut. 181ft. 
My deab Sir: 

Under date of 7th. instant, I had the honor to address you a ccwn- 
munication, covering three papers^ No. 1 and 3, being copies of letters 
sent^ and intended to Jiave been forwarded to Mr. Cafiedo, Secretary 
of State; with stcch explanations as I deemed necessary to a correct 
understanding of the position of things here and the motives which, 
induced said CommunicaticHis ; all which, with my subsequent and 
separate advices of 8th. and 15th. instant, will give you the mmute 
details of this part of my proceedings, with Govmt. 

I have now the honor further to wait on you with Translations 
No. 4 and 5, and copies 6, 7 and 8, which will complete my lett^^s 
thus far to Mr. Canedo. And I beg leave to adopt the same course 
in transmitting to you th^se papers, as when I forwarded the first 
three of the series — viz., that of brief explanatory comments on eack^ 
for the same reasons given you in my former letter of 7th. instant, to 
which, and documents enclosed, I beg reference in connection with 
this letter and its enclosv/res. No. 4. is a Translation of a private 
letter to Mr. Canedo, which will mainly explain itself. I was re- 
stricted by circumstances of policy from saying much in my letter 
sent to and received by Mr. Canedo, marked No 2. {It being substi- 
tuted for my ownj marked No i) and I thought that a private 
friendly letter, in which I could say what I pleased without com- 
promitting Mr. Canedo as Secretary, Would, or liight, produce a 
good effect, and in no way do any harm. It was well received and 
verbally acknowledged through Mr Pakanham with satisfactory 
reasons for not giving it a formal reply. 

No. 6. Translation of a private letter to Mr Almonte, which, in like 
manner, may sufficiently explain itself. But, permit me here to 
remark as regards this Gentleman that I had made two passing at- 
tempts to obtain a general and friendly interview with him, which 
he had avoided, and I knew he would, as a member of the cabinet, 
know all my movements, and doings with Mr. Canedo and the Gov- 
ernment Knowing, moreover, that he would be opposed to my 
objects, at least, at the com/mencem^nt, and in proportion as he found 
this opposition, met with the support of some of his colleagues, and 
the concurrence of the President; and further, being informed h>ow 
far he had committed himself with Congress i^i sending down from 
his Department the Iniciation of ways and m^eans to carry <mi the war 
against Texas and the other project^ declaring it Treason to tcdk or 
write in favour of the Views of Texas or in reference to the dis- 
memberment of the Territory; I say, OAJoare of these things, and

fearing his influence, I wanted to do something to conciliate and 
please him; and [so I wrote] my letter to him, which I thought 
could do no harm^ {even if he exhibited it) and mdght soften him 
down a little. To it however, I have received no reply whatever; 
perhaps because he is still committed with Congress in the passage 
of the above LawSj which are both still pending^ and dra^ hsa/oUy 
along in the chambers; or, it may be^ because he means to stand 
entirely uncommitted tentU he sees what course .the Govmt. and Con- 
gress will probably take as regards the Texas question generally. 

No. 6. Is copy of a letter I had prepared, to follow up the course 
opened to me, (as I then supposed) by the personal interview I had 
on the 1st. of Feby. with the Secretary, not doubting but Mr. Pahen- 
ham^ (as he had agreed to do) would remove the difficulty of absence 
of Credentials^ as would have been the case^ had not Mr. iCanedo 
changed ground and discovered that it would be very convenient 
to him^ as well as the Government to avail of the circumstance of 
my not having the tisual credentials to avoid further direct commu- 
nication with me as Agentj and thus throw all the responsibility on. 
Mr. Pakenham. 

No. 7. Was adopted m place of the dbovCj written in official form^ 
and duly signed by me, with my own name merely^ and, notwUfh- 
standing^ on handing it open to Mr P. for delivery, he said he did 
not think it would be received^ because it was signed by me. I de- 
sired him to try itj and if rejected on th/it account^ he might withdraw 
it, without throwing any new obstacle in the way of my primary 
object^ viz. that of placing before the Government the Views of 
TexaSj as drawn up by me and already transmitted you. This letter 
was received, notwithstanding objections were made, which shews 
that the Secretary does not always think alike on these points. 

No. 8. was written for the purpose of giving an official form and 
character to my Exposition] but on handing it to Mr Pakenham 
for delivery or transmission, he was so strongly of opinion that the 
form of the communication would cause its rejection by the Secre- 
tary, that I was, (very much against my inclination) induced to 
alter the form^ and hand the paper without address or signature, 
and merely dated in Mexico February 13th. 1840. 

Mr. Pakenham accompanied it with an official letter^ reccommend- 
ing its contents to the particular consideration of the Government. 

Nothing since has occurred between us, and I felt quite willing 
they should take a little time to translate and consider it on the part 
of the President^ as well as the different Members of the Cabinet. 
In the meantime I have persons in m/y confdence^ who can approach 
them all as opportunity offers and remove the rough and wirey^ edge 
of their first impressions^ (which are apt to be most dlarmin>g) on 
the subject.

If the Secretary intimates a wish to receive the propositions to 
which all this tends, they shall have them, after due consultation 
with Mr. Pakenham, of course. If the Government choose to rest 
here for a while, I may find it very convenient, for in the mea/ntime, 
I shall not he idle in bringing such influence, to hear on parties as 
shall be calculated to produce a good effect. They are Slow; and 
this is a frightful subject. Let them become a little more familiar 
with it, and let congress Reject the two projects before them, and I 
shall hope, then, for som^ action, soms approximation to the subject, 
and perhaps something like a disposition to arrange the matter on 
some reasonable hatns. Meanwhile, I still remain unknown to the 
public, as having anything to do with the Government or with 
Texas; and this enables the GovTnt. to weigh and reflect upon the 
question, without any interference, on the part of public out door 
opinions, or the criticisms of the Press. 

All which is Very respectfully submitted, in the h/>pe that the 
course I have adopted thus far, may meet with the favourable con^ 
sideration of the President and his constitutional advisers.

My dear Sir. 

In sending you, as the proper organ of the Government, the accom- 
panying communication in relation to an important subject, I cannot 
do less than to address you a private note, in view of the friendship 
and good feelings which has heretofore existed between us, which, on 
my part, I have not forgotten, nor shall I soon forget. 

If there was a time when you have known me interested in the 
welfare of Mexico, I am not less so, now. If when you best knew 
me, you was satisfied that I was a man of honor, frankness, and good 
faith, you may now repose in entire confidence that you will find in 
me still the same honourable principles. 

I have been much gratified to find that in the fulfilment of the 
duties which I have assumed, in regard to the subject matter con- 
tained in my other comnmnication, I shall come in contact with a 
person whom, I have before known, and, who has known m>e; inas-

much as it will thu8 be more Satisfactory to discuss this question, 
even altho' it may not increase the probabilities of its happy termina- 
tion. 

What I beg of you is that you will believe me when I assure you 
that if I have accepted the mission to which I have referred, it has 
not been exclusively to render a Service to Texas, but (dso because I 
thought I should be rendering an important one to your own Country. 
On this point, it would be easy to satisfy you, which I can do here- 
after. 

What I desire is that the Government^ of which you are a dis- 
tinguished Member, Should listen to the sentiments and wishes of the 
Government of Texas, and weigh the reasons there are in favour of 
an amicable arrangement^ before you decide upon a question which, 
// / do not greatly err^ is one of great interest, in any point of view in 
which you may consider it 

In fine^ I wish to have the pleasure of contributing with my Very 
feeble efforts^ united to your own, which are very^ if not all-powerfvl^ 
to the adjustment of the differences which exist between the two 
countries, and I believe the present the most opportune moment that 
can ever present itself to effect this object. 

So much the more satisfactory would the fulfilment of these 
wishes be to me, as I most firmly believe, that the true interests of 
your country will be promoted by the pacific termination of this 
question. But^ be this as it may, permit me to salute you individuaUy^ 
with all that regard due to the friendship and confidence with whidi 
you have honoured me in times past and to reiterate the respectful 
considerations to which you are entitled, from your former^ as wdl as

But whether this inference is correct or not, I take much pleasure 
in addressing you these few lines, renewing the intimacy and friend- 
ship with which you have honored me for so long a time. If I may 
be permitted to assume that there is no good reascm why we should 
not now be as good friends as ever. 

I will, then, be candid, as I am accustomed to be, and say to you 
without circumlocution that I am here as an Agent, entirely confi- 
dential and reserved for the present, of the Government of Texas, to 
confer with that of Mexico touching an amicable arrangement which 
will put an end to the differences which now exist between the two 
countries in a manner honourable and advantageous to Mexico, as 
well as Texas. 

Today or tomorrow I shall address the Secretary of State in rela- 
tion to the objects of my visit, soliciting a private interview^ as, I am 
inclined to think, is most advisable for the present^ 

I am aware that this announcement will not surprize you, and I am 
furthermore fvUy persuaded that the position you occupy in the Gov- 
ernment; the particular knowledge you possess in relation to this 
subject ; and the great influence you possess with the PreSdent and 
your colleagues in the Cabinet, will give your opinions much weight 
in the determination of your Government, as regards the matter in 
question. I say this, because I believe it. 

Under these circimistances, and with my opinions already before 
you, I address you this letter, in the hope that you will, as Minister 
and an ardent well wisher of the future prosperity of your country, 
take into consideration, this business, and reflecting thereon with your 
usual intelligence and patriotism, you may perchance satisfy yourself 
that the time has now arrived in which your Government may 7wt only 
listen to the friendly and pacific views of the Govmt of Texas; but, 
also, when measures may be adopted conducive to a good under- 
standing with your Northern Neighbors, and thus put an end to your 
mutual differences, and avoid the inconvenience of a prolonged 
struggle. 

But, whatever may be your opinions in regard to this question, and 
altho' I may have erred in thus anticipating your views, I trust you 
will listen to and weigh the reasons and advantages which may be 
justly alledged in favour of an honourable and advantageous ar- 
rangement to both parties. 

It would be Very gratifying to me to be able to contribute to the 
final and satisfactory arrangement of so interesting a question both 
to Mexico and Texas. You will yourself render an important Serv- 
ice to Your country, if you view this subject as I think you wiU. 
By co-operating with me in the use of your influence for the same 
laudable and patriotic purpose, and thus securing the advantages 
now attainable by Mexico, and also avoiding the sad consequences 
which might result from leaving matters as they now Stand,

the remedy was suggested that under the Guarcmtee of H. B.

I have now the Satisfaction to inform Y. E. that having con-

verry kindly offerred the Guarantee required, being in possessicm of 
satisfactory evidence other than that contained in my instructions

to place before Your Excellency in writing the Views and wishes of

In the Interview with which Y. E. honoured me, on Saturday the 
1st. inst at the Department of State, Y. E. adverted to the omision 
of my formal credential under the Seal of State of the Govmt. of 
Texas, and the remedy was suggested tluU under the Gnarantee of

from accidental circumstances, which I explained to Y. E.) might 
be supplied, until said credentials^ in due form, should be transmitted 
to me, in conformity with my Special request forwarded by duplicate 
to the President of Texas, on the day of our Conference. 

I regretted, however, to learn from Mr Pakenham, on Saturday 
last, that he could not with propriety give the Guarantee required by 
Y. E. to relieve me from the difficulty above cited ; Y. E was pleased 
to inform me, through H. B. Majesty's Minister, that any written 
communications I might think proper to address Y. E. on the Subject 
of my confidential mission woufd be received throught the medium of 
Said Minister. 

I therefore embrace this early opportunity to Salute Y. E. and to 
remark that I shall have the honor to transmit to Y. E. in a few 
days, and through this Same channel, the sentiments and views of the 
Govmt. of Texas more at length than I had the opportunity of doing 
verbally on the occasion of our interview, and in conformity with our 
understanding at that time.

Most Excellent Sir. 

In the interview with which I was honoured by Y. E. on the 1st. 
instant, my indisposition prevented me from communicating to 
Y. E, except very brieflyj the Views and Sentiments of the Govern- 
ment of Texas and Y. E. at my instance was pleased to say that I 
could present them in writing opportunely: I now therefore have 
the honour, to subjoin the following: 

" Brief Exposition " — (Here follows the paper, which I had pre- 
pared for this purpose, and at the conclusion I inserted, as follows)

COBBESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 577 

The Undersigned has omitted to State the propositions he is au- 
thorized by his Government to Make to the Govmt. of Mexico, as 
perhaps improper to make in this communication. He will, however, 
present them in writing whenever his Excy. the Secretary of State 
Shall be pleased to intimate to the undersigned his readiness to re- 
ceive them. 

Note. The Exposition^ has been forwarded as No. S^ under date of 
6th feby. The paper sent in is essentially the same^ with a few umm- 
portant ormsisons. True and Exact Copy of that sent to the Secre- 
tary shall be transmitted with Duplicates of the other corrnnMrdca- 
tions connected therewith in a few days.

My dear Sir. 

I have nothing of moment by this Post beyond what you will find 
in the a/^companying communications. I received a long and satis- 
factory letter from Gen. Hamilton, dated at N. Orleans, 3d. January, 
which I have replied to at lengthy on the 20th. inst.f and, shall again 
address him whenever I can inform him of further progress. 

I am most anxiously awaiting to hear from you, or the Department^ 
as, if Gen. Hamilton's suggestions and recommedations both to Mr. 
Pakenham and myself are in accordomce with the views of Govern- 
ment^ then^ of Course^ I must expect new and corresponding ^ instruc- 
tions from You. I hope and trust, it will not be long, before I shall 
have the satisfaction to receive them at length. 

I need not again call your attention to the contents of my several 
late despatches and the request for my full credentials and further 
instructions ; as I doubt not, they will be on their way ere this reaches 
You. I have heard Very recently that the plan of Government is to 
place on or near the frontiers from 5000. to lOpOO Men (as they best 
can) in the Expectation that they can tfien^ negotiate ^ on a more 
advantageous footing^ and obtain better terms and conditions than 
they can now expect. I should not be surprized if they should, desire 
to do this; but their ability to carry out the project on the score of 
means, I doubt very rwuch; even if Congress Sanction the measure^ 
which at the present moment May perhaps be questioned. If I find 
this idea well grownded^ I will further advise You, and in the mean- 
time I only mention it as a rumour^ based probably on the wishes of 
Govmt, rather than any fixed determination.

678 AMEMCAN HISTOBICAL AS800IATI0N, 

For my own part^ I do not heUeve they hare c(»ne to any determina- 
tion whatever on the general question of Tmos. When they oi^er- 
come their -first diflBculties, that of making up their minds whetJier 
they can Safely take hold of the question in earnest^ and decide ?u>w 
this delicate mutter is to be approached with safety to the popularity 
of the Cabinet and President^ then they will decide what will hesit 
suit their purposes. 

Then they have to depend on Congress for means to prepare for 
hostilities, if that be their course^ which it will be difficult for them 
to obtain. 

If they are disposed to treat in Sober earnest^ then^ they will re- 
quire the authority of Congress to negotiate. If, a« / Iiopej they 
wisely come to the latter determination, I think Congress will gramt 
the powers. If Govmt. are so timid that they are afraid to ask openly 
for powers to negotiate, then we must bring out the proposition from 
some a/i^i- Administration source^ and let enough of the Gotfmt. in, 
each House go for the measure as, with our friends will carry it 
through both bram^hes. To some oTie of these results, the matter wUl 
probably come sooner or later. TMs is my own impression at present. 

From Canales, we know nothing certain^ the accounts place him 
beyond the Rio Bravo. Arista is, with about 1000 men, at Monterey, 
CanalizOy with some 1200, in Matamoras, and Ampudia has, say, 600, 
in the same Vicinity; making about S800 Troops^ say 3000. Two 
thirds of this force might march to the del Norte in pursuit of 
Canales, put matters right on the frontier, and be on the Spot in 
readiness to form the Nucleus of the new invading Army; or the 
Division to alarm Texas into a liberal peace, and perhaps restricted 
boundaries: that is, if they can carry through the views attributed 
to them. 

WJiere the money is to come from^ I know no^, even to maintain 
the forces already there; and the Senate has, on the 17th, inst, re- 
jected the bill from the House asking for provision amd means to 
enable the Government to " Restore Texas, to the National TJniork^ 
It will, perhaps, be modified in the House, and if it obtains a two 
thirds vote; it can return again to the Senate, otherwise, not. We 
shall see. The French Minister has arrived, and was received day 
before Yesterday. His name is, Baron AUeye de Ciprey. 

Mr De LisUe, is indisposed. 

I Bemain, Sir, with regard and consideration 
Your obedient Servant.

Sir, 

I have the honor to endose jo\x by this day^s post the following 
Duplicaiea — viz., Dup. of my respects of 7th. inst covering dup^ 
copies of papers No. 1 and 8 inclusive: also Dup. of my respects of 
21st. inst. covering dup^ copies of papers No. 4 to 8 Indusive : and 
Duplicates of my last two communications, under dates of 15th. and 
22d. inst; to aU which I beg leave to refer you, in case their originals 
respectively should not have been received. 

I send the above with this letter to Vera Grus by this evening^s post^ 
but it will depend on circumstances whether they all go in one^ or 
are divided between two different Vessels^ bound to N. Orleans^ and 
they will complete the duplicates of all my letters, up to the present 
date. 

I am still without any advices frcxn Yourself or the department, 
tho' I am daily expecting them. I learn indirectly that Dr. Ritchie 
had received my despatches^ up to 20th. December, previous to 13th 
Jany. and I trust my subsequent letters home all arrived safely and 
promptly. 

I regret that I am not able to report farther progress in my affairs 
since my last of 22d. instants 

All we know is that my Exposition has been translated and sub- 
mitted to a CcAinet eounselj and StiU remains under the consideration 
of the Qovmt without any reply whatever to Mr. Pakenham. I 
presume the Govmt. have been veiy much occupied on business of 
preference J as they have received news from Tuoatan and other points 
which is imfavourable to the continuance of tranquility in that 
Departmient. 

Mr Pakenham will press the Govmt. to an early decision on his 
own account J as he is very desirous to transTnit some determination to 
Lord Pahnerston. I presume during the coming wedc we shall hear 
something from the Secretary. 

The advices from Yucatan above referrd. to State that the revolu- 
tion that has been on foot there for some time is making serious head- 
way, and it is feared the whole department m^y concur in the grito 
for fed^ation* It is said that troops are to be sent from Vera Cruz. 
It is difficulty to learn facts here^ but the next arrival will give us 
something decisive of the first movement. Private letters speak of 
the movement as Very general. An abortive movement at Perote 
and another on the South Coast Shew that the elements are in com-

motion. The death of General Cortazar^ Governor and commandant 
general of the Department of Guanahuato^ which State, has always 
sustained its independence and never bowed to Centralism^ leaves a 
Vacancy J which it is difficult for the Govmt. to fill without some disa- 
greement with the local authorities and Troops. 

A Sort of Rupture [has occurred] between Arista and Candles who 
were negotiating an arrangement or an armistice. And the con- 
tinued labours of the opposition and St. Anna's party give the Govmt. 
many unquiet moments. 

I regret all these things, for they are aU calculated to fetter the 
hands and distort the heads of Govmt and render them more timdd 
as regards our affair. 

The measures before described Still hang in Congress. The Texas, 
hill has not yet been called up for discussion since the committee of 
the House, withdrew their report, and changed the tenor of the con- 
tribution. 

The Bill declaring it Treason to advocate the rights of Texas, and 
that abridging the liberty of the Press^ are both still pending. The 
faie of all three of these measures may be considered doiibtfuL The 
two latter, the Govmt. will not press. The former they would like to 
carry, as it would give them means, tho' it is doubtful if much of 
the amt would go towards renewing the War against Texas. 

I have heard nothing since My last about the rumoured project of 
Sending 5000 or 10000 Men on to the frontiers. It has all probably 
been forgotten in the Multiplicity of other Matters of more imme- 
diate consequence. It is further Stated, that Mr Almonte, is de- 
sirous, to go to London as Minister; and Mr Canedo will go to Wash- 
ington as Commissioner, under the convention between this Grovmt. 
and the U. States.** I should not be surprized, if both these reports 
Should prove true — ^particularly the latter, Tho' I wish the form,er 
might take place forthwith, as his influence against us would tJven 
Cease. 

I am Sorry I have Nothing of greater interest to commimicate, hut 
So it is. / hope in my next I shall be able to say something more 
cheering. The french Charge Mr De Lislle will be obliged to r^nain 
here some time with the New Minister.

Subnet to Tkeat.® 

Republic of Texas 

Department of State 
Atistm 12th March 18Jfi. 
Jaues Tbeat Esqr 
Sir, 

I have the pleasure to acknowledge various communications from 
you directed to the President, the most recent bearing date the 8th 
Ulto. 

This Government has omitted to address you heretofore, because of 
the peculiar delicacy oi your position. That obstacle to a free inter- 
course being removed by ihe formal disclosure of your Mission to the 
authorities of Mexico, It affords me great pleasure to be again the 
mediimi of conununication between the President and yourself. 

During the late session of Congress the President completed his 
cabinet organization, by inviting the Honorable Abner S. Lipscomb 
into the Dept. of State. Mr Lipscomb being at present absent, on 
private business, at the special request of the President, I again take 
temporary charge of the Department. 

We have been much gratified with the zeal and prudence you have 
manifested, in the discharge of the very important and delicate duties 
committed to you, and the President requests me to assure you of his 
cordial approbation. 

A commission as Agent with plenary powers is herewith trans- 
mitted, authorizing yx>u to negotiate a treaty of Recognition, amity 
and boundaries, and to stipulate for the future making a more ample 
Treaty of Commerce etc, It is not thought advisable to embarrass 
the present preliminary negotiation with any of the little but often 
vexatious questions relating to the commercial intercourse with Na- 
tions so situated in juxtaposition as are Texas and Mexico. If 
Mexico is sincere in desiring peace, the Government of Texas will 
always be disposed to reciprocate every benefit which the respective 
interconmiunications of trade may confer, but these must be ad- 
justed as between independent powers. 

I enclose you an official Letter to Mr Pakenham, to whom we feel 
under many obligations for the very frank and honorable manner in 
which he has assisted your efforts. That the Government of Great 
Britain will eventually realize important benefits from the separate 
independence of Texas in the hands of the Anglo Saxon race is a fact 
too obvious to escape the discernment of so intelligent a Gentleman 
as Mr Pakenham, and he has wisely anticipated events by imposing 
essential obligations upon this infant Grovemment, which it can never 
cease to recognize and appreciate.

I do not know that any further specific instructions are necessary. 
The future and permanent harmony of the two powers requires a 
well defined line of demarcation. The Rio Grande presents one and 
is eminently adapted to the purpose. 

You will freely consult with Mr. Pakenham and so far as may be 
practicable without jeopardizing the ultimate objects, you will con- 
form to any suggestions he may make relative to the fin^l disposition 
of the consideration to be paid to Mexico. 

This Government can have no objection to the British holders of 
Mexican bonds deriving an incidental benefit from the negotiation in 
which you are engaged. But we believe that even great Britain has 
an eventual beneficiary interest in the success of your efforts, which 
will be paramount to any present advantages that can accrue to 
those bond holders, and that therefore the appropriaticm of the 
instalments to their benefit should not be permitted to embarrass 
seriously your principal operations. 

You are informed that certain Chiefs of the Federal Party are 
in arms in the vicinity of the Rio Grande, and that some Anglo- 
Americans have united with them. The President, in strict con- 
formity with his professed desires for peace, very promptly issued 
his proclamation, enjoining all Texian citizens to abstain from hostili- 
ties against the Government of Mexico,** a copy of which he trans- 
mitted to the Chief of the Anglo Americans who were imderstood 
to have joined the Federalists, by Lieutenant Col. Johnson the 
Assistant Adjutant General of our Army. That gallant Officer with 
his escort, was intercepted on his return by a large party of Mexicans, 
and cruelly put to death. This is an event not calculated to assuage 
the feelings of a people already provoked by unwarranted and un- 
christian Massacres, or to soften the rigors of the War should it be 
actively renewed. But in as much as this atrocity is reported to 
have been perpetrated by a desultory band of ruffians without the 
express authority of the Government, the President will not regard 
it as an insuperable obstacle to the proposed negotiation. But it 
may be considered as an infallible assurance, that if hostilities are 
to continue, they will be conducted with increased animation by an 
indignant people who know how to avenge a wrong which they would 
never commit 

With great regard I have the 

honor to be your Obdt Servant

tion of the Country, and the position of the Government, both which 
have an important bearing on all the leading measures of the Gk)vmt. 
and especially on the Subject which alone claims my attention. 

The Revolution of Yucatan has gone through the whole peninsula, 
or department, with the exception of the City and Port of Cam/peche^ 
where the Garrison and people Shewed a disposition to defend them- 
selves, and even march against the Revolutionists, at the Capital of 
Merida. Our ri'ext advices will inform us whether they have 
Surrendered^ are are besieged, or have Made some peaceable arrange- 
meuL The motto of the Revolutionists is Federation^ under the old 
Constitution^ until amended by a Convention. Four Hundred Troops 
have embarked from Vera Cruz, but no information of their arrival 
has been Yet received. They may be intercepted, as it is said the 
federalists have an armed Brig off Campeche. 

The Smaller movements on the South Coast continue, and particu- 
larly a recent one at Zelaya^ a Town in Guanahuato, the Extent of 
which is not exactly known. 

Candles is organizing a sort of Contention in which all the States 
or departments are invited to be represented, on the 1st. May. Of 
course^ they must f/rst throw off the central Yoke by a Revolution. 

The bill So long before Congress to provide Ways and Means to 
restore Texas to the union was finally lost in the Senate a few days 
since, by an almost unanimous Vote; two thirds and Two more hav- 
ing Voted Contra. 

The bill against the liberty of the press was, submitted to The 
Supreme Court of Justice for their opinion, (which they sometimes 
do, in important matters, altho' their opinion, has no binding force 
on Govmt. or Congress) and they were unanimously against it. It 
remainds to be seen, whether Govmt. will still press it upon Congress. 

The hiU declaring it Treason to talk or write about the dismem- 
berment of the National Territory; or promote, the Views, and 
interests of Texas, stUl lies dormant^ and I presume never will be 
recuMtated. 

I have now reason to think that- Mr. Cafiedo, the Minister for 
foreign affairs^ will not abandon his situation at the head of the 
Ministry for any foreign Post. 

Three appointments are to be made for the United States : viz. — a 
minister to supply the place of Mr. Martinez Pizarro deceased '^ and 
two Commissioners under the Convention Indemnity.^ Of the lat- 
ter, one only is appointed, Mr. Pedro F. del Castillo. Thus you See 
that the Govmt. has its hands full in the direction of the domestic 
concerns of the Nation. 

The President, and Cabinet, as well as many of the men in Con- 
gress and the other departments of Govmt think that peace and vn-

temdl tranquility are the first things to be attained and that it is 
justifiable to ViolMie the Constitution^ and oommit ohviaw^ tho' tern- 
porary^ injustice, to attain these objects. 

Their promisesy for reform and improTement are ample, but they 
are Slow in the Execution of them. 

The other party ^ Called Federalists are diyided into tv$o ; one, the 
Moderate and amalgamaticm party, and the other the Exalted* (Bx- 
altados) or Violent party, who wc^d destroy the Ecclesiastical party 
and influence at a single blow. The Leader of the former is Pe- 
droMsr^ and the laJbter^ Farias. Yet hotk are called Federalists and 
liberals^ and belong to the opposition, or progressive party, now so 
called. 

Here you have the leading parties in the country. 

As regards St. Anna, he has a Small party only, and is cont^it to 
oppose the Govmt without either of the other parties being wUling 
to adopt him as belonging to their creed, and principles. He always 
likes to belong to his own party ^ where he can conirovly and when 
not^ goes on the Strongest Side, where he can promise himself the 
most influences, or remains Neutral. 

Under these circumstances, you will readily perceive Sir, that my 
progress must necessarily be comparatively Slow. Still some slight 
advances have be^i made since I last reported, which I will detail in 
another letter to accomfoay this. I will here add that I am StUl 
without any advices from yourself or the department of State, which 
I am most anxiously and daily expecting. 

On the 16th. instant, I received from Col. Love two Letters, dated 
8th. and 12th. Jaryy^ forwarded me by Dr. Ritchie from New Orleans, 
under date 1st inst, being the only advices I have from Texas since 
my arrival here. 

They were brought by the Creole^ arrived at V. Cruz 11th. inst. 
The U States Bevenue Cutter, Woodbury, arrived just before in four 
days from N. Orieans; and Sailed again forthwith without my 
knowledge. 

She brought nothing but despatdies for Mr Ellis, and took away 
the Ratified Convention. This latter is the only vessel yet sailed 
from* V. Cruz for N. O. during the present month.

C61tBfiSP0NDENCfi WITH MEXICO. SSt 

Tfi£AT TO LaHAR.^ 

{Dnplioate. CoHfldentlal.] 

Mexico, March 27th. 181ft. 
Sir, 

Referring to my respects of day before Yesterday, I now proceed to 
inform you of the progress made in my affairs with the Government 
Since my last report under date of 29th. TJlt. I have before remarked 
that it was deemed good policy by Mr Pakenham, as well as myself, 
to give the Govmt. ample time to consider and reflect upon my Expo- 
sition, without pressing the Secretary for any reply thereto, believing 
(what has since been verified) that the longer they had it under con- 
sideration, the greater effect it would produce on their own minds; 
and the greater opportunity would be afforded to enlighten themselves 
on the general question by consulting their friends out of doors^ and 
becoming more and more familiar with the subject^ which, in the first 
instance,^ could hardly be adverted to so extremely a delicate matter 
was it almost universally considered. 

For the above reasons, and, because the Govmt. have been much occu- 
pied with the Unquiet state of the Country and an expected movement 
in this city which caused the guards to be doubled and the Troops 
under arms for Some week or ten days ; there has been greater delay 
than I wished for, or anticipated ; altho' I am well satisfied that this 
delay has produced some good results, as Mr Pakenham, myself, and 
friends have not been Silent nor idle on the question at issue, and 
Some changes of opinion have been brought about. 

About ten days Since, the Secretary of State broached the Subject 
to Mr. Pakenham, and Stated, in substance, That the paper, or ex- 
position, has been translated, and placed before the Cabinet, where 
it has been duly considered. That, being an Ex-parte argument and 
without containing any propositions, he would receive any further 
Communication, containing the propostitions of the Govmt. of Texas ; 
and they would then have the whole Tnatter before them. 

Mr. P. assented ; stated that I was ready to present the propositions, 
I had been authorized to make to the Mexican Govemmt. ; and was 
only waiting, an intimation to that effect, from the Secretary. After 
some further conversation Mr P. took leave, with a request from Mr 
Cafiedo that he would be glad to See Tne. Three or four feast days 
ensued Consecutively, and having mean time met him at a public Ball, 
he invited m^ to call, and named the day and hour. I had an hour 
and a half uninterrupted conversation with him. He not only re- 
peated all he had said to Mr. P. but went much further. 

As in the case of our previous interviews, this was not only con- 
sidered unofficial, but confidential.

&8§ AM&ttlOA^ HIStOElOAL AdSOOtATlOK. 

He said he had no objection to inform me privately, and tndz" 
vidually [of] any thing and every thing I might wish to Imow, in rela- 
tion to the object of my mission, satisfied that I was fully entitled to 
his personal confidence, and would only use the remarks he might 
make to me with the Executive of Texas, in my communicaticms, and 
then it must be understood as confidential^ and that no publidiy 
should be given to any opinions he might utter, or information he 
might Communicate to m^ as above. 

He then proceeded to State his own individual opinion (favourable 
to an amicable and prompt arrangement.) 

The opinion of the President is wholly opposed to recognition, but 
would perhaps assent to an Armistice; and in like manner, the 
balance of the Cabinet — ^vrz: Almonte, opposed to any inmiediate 
action, and probably wishes to negotiate at the Head of an Army. 
The Secretary of the Interior reserves his opinion until he informs 
himself further. And the Secretary of the Treasury, having no 
opinion of his own on this Subject will be Governed by the majority. 

The Secretary then informed me what he had done to Secure for 
my mission a full consideration and perchance some result that 
should approximate the wishes of Texas. 

He had furthet consulted the opinions of distinguished men of 
the Councils of Govmt. and others out, of oftice, and written to some 
out of the city. That he had found some to concur with himself, 
others willing to do something, less than recognition; and others 
who were opposed to any arrangement. He hxid become convinced 
that Something must now, or soon, be done. As regards Congress, 
he said. No calculation could possibly be made with any degree of 
Certainty how they would act, if any proposition touching this mat- 
ter was placed before them. If it emanated from Govmt. it would 
be certain to be opposed by the opposition. That he had laboured 
much to keep the subject open, and give it all the impulse he could, 
but that, as the Cabinet was a sort of Unit, he could &nly by his own 
personal and official influence endeavour to gain, in favour of the 
general question, sufficient supporters to justify the Govemmt, in 
acting on the subject, whenever public [opinion] Should be prepared 
for the question. Shall we Surrender Texas? That in consideration 
of this State of things, and other considerations of similar bearing 
which he had related very fully and very frankly And, (as I think,) 
very truly, he was free to say to me then that he did n/)t believe the 
Govmt. could or would accede to the Main question, viz — Recognition. 
That they had no objections to do somethdng towards your widies and 
prevent hostilities until the time Should come round, when the 
Govemmt could act with more freedcan and certainty of Success; 
and when the public feeling would justify an open and public negotia-

tion. Said something, about an Armistioe, and the willingness of 
Govmt. that the dctudl state of things might continue without the 
Surrender formally of its sovereignty. 

So much for the Secretary's friendly and candid Expose^ which / 
viewed as given with great frankness, and in all good faith. Had 
his objects been sinister^ I am quite Sure, I should have discovered it. 

He closed on his part by Saying thait^ in his opinion, the time was 
not far distant (he could not even intimate when) but he would 
say, ^'not far distant ^^ when the exciting difficulties might be 
removed, and the question entertained with a very great degree of 
Certainty of Success. 

He then said that he should be glad to receive my propositions, 
that of course I might ask or propose whatever my instructions 
authorized, without regard to this conversation; That he should do 
all that he could, considering his position to promote the object gen- 
erally but that it would not do me nor the question at issue any good 
for him to insist on any particular point beyond those which might 
be agreed upon by the Cabinet^ whose unammity was desirable on any 
points that might finally be adopted. That I might consider myself 
fully authorized to call and see him whenever I pleased, and If I 
wished a long interview^ to send him a Note, and he would appoint a 
time. 

I do not consider my remarks on this occasion, of much importance, 
and especially as I was for the most part a listener. Suffice it to say, 
for the present, thM, considering his whcde conversation as entirely 
and beyond question a true and candid exposition of the real State 
of the question and its difficulties, /, of course, gave it my apparent 
credence, and so far as I had any occasion to Speak, manifested a 
corresponding personal frankness and confidence. 

Having no secrets myself, I could not confide anything to him; 
but I said in Svhstance, That this matter of Peace between the two 
countries involved, of course, Recognition; — Th/zt, I had hoped to 
find the stability of the Government and the 'state of the country 
Such that the question could be taken up at once and discussed 
freely; and that the popularity of the Govmt. and the intelligence of 
Congress as well as public opinion, would Support the Executive in 
any honourable and advantageous arrangement. That the question 
with the people of Texas, as well as the Govmt. was a very simple 
one. They had been several years in quiet possession of the Country. 
Had extended their jurisdiction over that part which they now 
claimed. Had established their Govmt. on a solid foundation. Had 
been acknowledged by two powerful naticms — and her resources and 
means of defence, as well as offence, gave her full confidence, that 
die could defend all she now as^ for from Mexo.

Under tfieee circumstances she had ccmie to Mexico, after long for- 
bearing to do am/thing to weaken her claim on the Mother country 
for Peace, and proposed a liberal indemnity for Recognition and the 
only rational, or permanent boundary, that can be adopted between 
the two countriea That I was sorry to find there was not power, 
or fortitude enough in the GoTmt. Departments, to take the question 
up, as a Matter of business, and decide it at once on principles of 
reason and sound poUey. That I could well anticipate the disap- 
pointments that the failure of my missiwi would- produce in Texas, 
etc. etc. etc. 

By4; that, not withstanding, I would present my propositions in 
behalf of the Government of Texas, and through the usual Medium 
of Mr. Pakenham. 

I reported this interview to Mr. P. and requested Aim, to throw 
himself in the Secretary's vray, and furnish him an opportunity to 
repeat what he had said to me, which was done, and the Same frank- 
ness and candour pervaded the whole conversation, So that Mr. P 
considered the Secretary's Expose entitled to full credence. 

I consulted Mr. Pakenham and submitted to him the Proposi- 
tions I had thought best, under aU the circumstances^ to submit to 
Govmt. which he approved of and enclosed them in an o-fflcial letter 
to the Secretary two days Since, and was promised, that they should, 
have dv>e course^ as Understood. 

I have the honor to enclose you a copy of the propositions referred 
to, marked A, for your information, and, as I hope, approbation. 

The object in thus reducing it to a Single proposition was to test 
the Main point, viz Recognition, and I considered my best policy to 
leave the two other points Blank viz : Boundaries and Consideration, 
hoping that the naked question, of Recognition, (without a defini- 
tion of boundary or naming compensation) would stand a better 
chance of favourable consideration and perhaps prevent a pnHnpt 
and absolute return of the proposition as wholly inadmissible. 

Besidesj Mr Canedo knows, and so does Mr Almonte, very weU^ 
(and if the rest of Cabinet do not, the Secretary of State Can, ♦/ A^ 
thinks it good policy^ inform them) that the Consideration cannot 
exceed four and a half or five Millions of Dollars ; and the limits re- 
quired are the Rio Bravo del Norte. 

Had I filled up the Blanks j I should have Said : Four millions, and 
Bio Bravo del Norte. 

There are some circumstances calculated to operate favourably 
on this Tnain question^ which is the main difficulty. My friends, who 
are at work, (very cautiously, but with scmie effect) report more 
favourably as regards the opinicms of others; and Mr. Pakenham 
was informed by the Secretary (since / have seen the latter) that

even the President had become more tractable or leM obstinfltQ, and 
that the Texas gicestion^ had lost some^ of its terrors^ at least; aU 
which^ is the result of time in whidi to think and reflect; for they 
are notoriously a slow people in every thmg^ and when hurried, of 
course^ always go against your views. 

Hence^ time is indispensable to effect anythmg^ h^re. Notwith- 
standing all this I anticipate a return of or answer to^ my proposal, 
as inadmissible on account of the Alienation of the Sovereignty of 
the Territory. This^ is my own opinion, of course^ mainly fetmded^ 
on the Secretary's private opinion^ and communications, to me as 
well as other concurring testimony and circumstances^ 

The most I can reascmably hope for 4$ that they may suspcoid 
any decision or absolute negative, Ofid usk that the blanks be filled 
up, as without thatj they have not^ in fact, the whole matter before 
them. 

// so J I shall fill them as already Stated ; Bio Bravo and fottr mdl- 
lions^ as it will be weU enough understood that " Four " means four 
and a half to Five; in case there are Tto incidental Expenses attend- 
ing the negotiations which^ under any circumstances, there must nec- 
essarily be, and probably heavy. Of course^ a broad margin should 
be left for this contingency^ should it occur. 

ThiSj then^ is the present State of the question^ and if the proposi- 
tion as already made^ or, when amended^ by filling up the blanks; 
Should be absolutely rejected^ I presume the Secretary wiU then 
present Some counter-propositions Stating what they are willing to 
do, and perhaps holding forth some future prospects of Becognition, 
and proposing meantime an armistice, under certain conditions, etc, 
etc. etc. In fact^ the Secretary himself did not know exactly what 
these views were^ or would be, on being discussed in Cabinet; but 
intimated Very generally something like the above. These counter 
propositions, whatever they may be, I shall receive, and engage to 
forward, or convey myself, to the Government of Texas; aitho^ it 
muy be in violation of the letter of a part of my instructions; for I 
am Sure it wUl n^t be contrary to the tenor and spirit of the Whole. 

This done^ I shall, of course, rest until I have the honor to receive 
your further views and instructions; and shall be happy if they, 
will enable me soon to pay my personal Bespects to the President of 
Texas. 

I am now in daily expectation of advices from the Department 
which will give me sucih further instructions as may have arisen, 
from a change in your views; for, as I have before remarked, the 
letters from Gren. Hamilton to Mr. Pakenham, before his arrival at 
and, especially since his departure from Texas, shew dearly that an 
arrangement Would now be assented fo verry different trota What 
my instructions contemplated at their date.

Sir: 

The enclosed letter of 25ih. inst and the duplicate within should 
have accompanied my last respects of 28th.* Inst., Sent to Vera Cruz 
by the last post; but I could not finish the Copy in time, and hence I 
send them herewith by this evenings mail and have no doubt they 
will be in time for one of the two Vessels bound for N. Orleans; so 
that both despatches will probably arrive at- the same time. 

Since closing my letter, on the evening of the 28th. indisposition 
(arising from a cold taking by bathing) has prevented my calling to 
see either Mr. Caiiedo or Mr. Pakenham, which I had intended doing 
before I again addressed You, and to have added anything new or 
interesting I might have gathered from either Source. Had Mr. 
Pakenham have had anything of importance, lie would have called on 
me, but not So with regard to Mr. Cafiedo. 

I therefore can report no further progress in business matters; nor 
do I believe any Step has been taken in the Palace for several days, as 
the changes in the Cabinet now reduced to a great degree of Cer- 
tainty have no doubt occupied Much the attention of the Ministers. 
The arrangement now on the Tapis is that Mr. Almonte^ Secy, of 
War and Navy, proceeds to Brussels ; and Mr. Cuei^as^ Secretary of 
the Interior, shall go to St. James. These nominations will take

have rid herself of one of her most bitter enemies Jiere^ and perhaps 
two ; as Mr Cuevas has not yet declared his opinion /wBy. What we 
shall gain depends on who may fill their places. I do no4 think we 
can lose anything. 

It is Still asserted that Mr. Canedo also will escape from the 
ministry, probably to the U. States, so soon as he can fill the State 
department to the satisfaction of the President. 

This, however, is decidedly in opposition to his own assurances to 
me that he would not accept of any foreign appcnntment whatever. 
It is believed by some that these contemplated changes in the Cabinet 
are the precursors of a more liberal System^ in the future policy of 
the Government. In other Word^ — they find the Tension to its 
utmost^ and fear a Revolution^ hence, a Modification of their policy 
to conciliate and thus ward off or delay the apprehended re-action, 
^i the President fills the Vacancies in his Cabinet by Federalists it 
will sufficiently confirm this Idea, 

The first period of the ordinary Session of Congress for the present 
Year expires this day; being three months from the Commencement 
of the Year, This ordinary Session is prorogued for the purpose of 
acting on Sundry Specified subjects^ and among them one which 
reads Thus : " To take into consideration, everything which relates 
to the restoration of Texas to the National Union." This gives room 
for the further discussion of the subject, and we shall, if the Oovnit, 
TnovCy see what course tfiey will now recommend, after having failed 
in all their efforts for three Months to obtain ways and Means for 
the War. 

Perhaps some Member may be found bold enough to propose a 
Committee to examine the whole Subject and Report their opinion 
of what the interests and honor of the Country require^ in relation to 
this Subject. 

I trust ere long I shall be in possession of Your further wishes and 
instructions, so that I can close my negotiation in Some way or other, 

Until I do receive them^ 1 shall continue making every effort to 
gain as much ground as possible, for I am m/>re and more satisfied 
that tho' not n/>w perhaps^ Yet ere long, the negotiations can be car- 
ried through. I also hope that my repeated request for funds and 
also on the part of Gen, Hamilton, who wrote to the Secy of the 
Treasury in my behalf, will not have been forgotten, 

A friend of mine who has just calld. in Says the city is rife with

credentials asked in yours of a previous date, had been forwarded 
by Judge Burnet in my absence, and I hope they have been received

We have great difficulty in forwarding you available funds, and 
are not certain that the mode now suggested, will be successful under 
existing circumstances. However it is thought to be the one most 
likely to serve your purposes. You will therefore be authorized to 
draw on Messrs Hamilton and Burnley, Texas Loan Commissioners 
in London, for such an amount as will realize to you two thousand 
dollars. 

I take this opportunity to renew to you, the assurance of the great 
satisfaction the President feels, at the zeal and ability you have dis- 
played in the discharge of the delicate trust reposed in you, and his 
entire confidence, in your continued efforts to bring your Mission to a

Gentlemen, 

This Government has found great diflSculty, in supplying Mr 
Treat with necessary funds in Mexico, hoping the best results from 
your efforts to procure the loan, and that you will be in funds in 
time; The President has authorized Mr Treat to draw on you in 
London for such amount as will realize to him two thousand dollars. 
If he can negotiate a bill at all, it is possible that it can be done wiUi- 
out any great sacrifice in that small amount. 

The Authority to enter into Commercial Arrangements with the 
French Government for the reduction of duties etc. etc, in the event 
of their successfully aiding you in the sale of our bonds has been for- 
warded to you, and the best results are anticipated frcma that quarter. 
For the views of the President on the subject of such arrangement 
with the French Government I refer you to my letter of 24th Febru- 
ary, addressed to General Hamilton, a duplicate of which is herewith 
enclosed. Our last advices from Mexico, authorize the hopes that a 
treaty of Recognition and boundary can be obtained. We are not in 
much danger of invasion, of a serious character in any event, as the 
internal condition of Mexico forbids such an enterprize. 

The loan and a treaty with Mexico, would place our Young Re- 
public in a condition of prosperity not surpassed by any over the 
Globe. 

With great respect

In fulfilling the wishes of Mr. Pakenham, which I do with much 
satisfaction (as I am under great obligations to him for his personal

result, having a considerable sum of money at stake in a grant of 
land made by the Grovemment of the State of Tamaulipas to one 
Manuel Bangs, dated 27th. Feby. 1835, for the settlement of a colony 
of 250 foreign families, on the left bank of the Rio Bravo del Norte, 
beginning opposite Camargo, and following the bank of the River

quantity of land should be found to satisfy the claims of all the set- 
tlers, and that of the Empresario for his premium land. Mr. Bangs 
transferred all his right, title and interest in the grant to me, and 
placed me in his stead by virtue of an irrevocable power of Attorney ; 
and on my return to this place in the month of July 1835, I set to 
work to organise a plan for peopling the colony. I opened a corre- 
spondence with my friends in. Scotland, and listed them in the en- 
terprise. They accordingly collected the requisite number of &mi- 
liee, and engaged ships to carry them out, and when neariy ready for 
embarkation, the enterprise was abandoned in consequence of intelli- 
gence communicated by me of the existence of the hostilities whidi 
broke out on the frontier betwe^i Mexico and Texas in tiie latter 
part of 1835 and the beginning of 1636, therdby occasioning disap- 
pointment to the intending colonists, and manifest loss to myself and 
friends. 

In the month of December 1836 the Congress of Texas made a 
declaraticm defining the boundaries of the B^ublic, wherd^y it 
sweeped in the land lying between the Bio Grande (or Bravo) and 
the Nueces, within which the grant above menticmed is situated. 

When the next Congress assembled in May 1887 I sent an agent to 
Texas for the purpose of enquiring into the particulars regarding 
the position of said grant, and the result was that the Government of 
Texas had laid claim to the said tract of land embraced in the 
grant, and that all Empresarios must be governed by the " 14tii 
"Article of the Plan of the Provisional Government of Texas, 
"adopted in the month of November 1835, by which it is decreed 
" that all the vacant lands of Texas are the property of this Eepublic, 
" and that all land Commissioners, Empresarios, surveyors or persons 
" in anywise concerned in the location of lands be ordered forthwith 
"to cease their operations during the agitated and unsettled state 
" of the Country, and continue to desist from further locations until 
"the land Office can be properly systematized by the competent 
" Authority which may hereafter be established " etc* By the decla- 
ration of rights appended to the Constitution of Texas ^ on the 2nd. 
March 1836, "It is declared that all the vacant lands within the 
"limits of Texas became the property, or public domain of the

boundaries of the Republic of Ttexas,*^ it is enacted " That from and 
" after the passage of this Act, the civil and political jurisdiction of

"subject alone to the disposition of the same" — dated 12th. June 
1837.« 

According to the above quoted enactments it appears that I am 
entirely shut out and prevented from perfecting the terms of the 
grant on my part, as the representative of the grantee, Manuel 
Bangs, in so far as regards Texas. But as I am aware that no State 
can take possession of any part or portion of another State, except by 
purchase, cession or conquest, and knowing, as I do, that the Gov- 
ernment of Texas has performed none of these ceremonies, conse- 
quently this Republic of Texas has no virtual rights to the tract 
of land in question, as matters stand at present, I have therefore 
considered it my duty to lay this statement before you, so that when 
the period arrives for your mediation between Mexico and Texas, 
my interest, as a British subject, in this contract may be respected, 
and the usual protection afforded to all previous existing contracts 
in any arrangement that may hweafter take place between the con- 
tending Parties. 

I am ready, and at all times willing to fulfil my part of the con- 
tract, and as I am prevented from performing by the peculiar situa- 
tion and circumstances of the other contracting Party, the least 
amount of indemnity to which I am fairly entitled should be the 
premium land, thirty Sitios and thirty Labors, by virtue of the Con- 
tract and the colonization law of Tamaulipas of the 17th. November, 
1833,* to say nothing of the advantages which would have accrued 
to me from having the far famed Salt Lakes of Tamaulipas within 
the bounds of the grant. 

Being already well assured of your marked attention to all the 
best interests of claimants imder your paternal protection, I shall 
add no more on this subject. 
I have etc

[Copy.] 

New Orleans, 20th, August^ 1839. 
Sir, 

I have been appointed the Agent of the heirs, in Scotland, of 
Doctor James Grant, deceased, who was a native of Scotland, was a 
resident at one period at Parras, and member of the Congress of 
Coahuila and Texas, and who was killed on the frontier between 
Mexico and Texas on the 2nd. March, 1836. 

Ha\nng been informed that you have been appointed by the 
British Government to mediate between Mexico and Texas, I there- 
fore beg leave to represent to you that the late Doctor Grant was 
interested, directly, in contracts with the Government of the State of 
Coahuila and Texas for the purchase of 350 Certificates, calling for 
a Sitio of land each, in the vacant tracts of the State, and indirectly, 
in 150 similar Certificates. I have in my possession the contract for 
the first 300 Certificates sold to Dr. Grant, and on the back of which 
there is a receipt for the full payment of the purchase price; and I 
have reason to believe that all the other purchases were duly paid. 

The hostilities which broke out between Mexico and Texas in 1835 
and 1836 prevented the Agents of Dr. Grant from getting these Cer- 
tificates located and the correspcmding titles issued to the land. 

During the year 1836 the Government of the people of Texas took 
possession of the Country, declaring themselves free and inde- 
pendent ; and they passed laws prohibiting the location of any claims 
for land, existing under previous contracts with the General as well 
as with the State Governments of the Mexican Republic. Conse- 
quently the heirs of the late Dr. Grant, and other virtual claimants 
on these 500 Certificates are left with 50,000 Dollars' worth of them 
in their hands, and without any remedy in the present state of the 
political affairs of Texas. 

The object of addressing you on this subject is to be in time, and 
to enjoy the benefit of your official interposition, in the event of a 
speedy settlement of the difficulties existing between Mexico and 
Texas. 

I find the affairs of the deceased involved in almost inextricable 
difficulties; and, unless we succeed in making good these contracts, 
there will not be sufficient to satisfy the just claims on the Estate, 
far less to relieve the pressing necessities of his numerous children. 
For their sakes, I do hope and trust that we may succeed through 
your valuable instrumentality. 

I have opened a correspondence with a person at Monclova, with a 
view of ascertaining the position of the late Dr. Grant's affairs at 
Parras, and should there exist any hope of recovering any thing in

that quarter for the benefit of the heirs, I may be induced to make a

My dear Sir. 

Under this date, I have addressed the Hon. the Secretary of State, 
and enclosed him two papers for his consideration and reply, to all 
which I beg leave to refer you for particulars. 

I have done this at the request of Mr Pakenham H. M's. Minister, 
to whom, as you are already fully aware, we are under great obliga- 
tions for his unwearied devotion to our interests in my negotiations 
with the Govmt. 

As regards the matter involved, of Course I have nothing to Say, 

as tJiat will stand on its Merits, but permit me to solicit an early ^ and 

as fuU^ a reply to Mr. Pakenham as the nature of the case will admit. 

Referring you to a long communication of this days date, and 

forwarded by this Conveyance, 

I remain, my dear General, in Haste, 

but Very truly and cordially Your 
Most obedient Servant, 

James Treat.

through the kind attention of Mr. Pakenham, hoping it may find an 
early ocmveyance to N. Orleans and thence to its destination. 

The mam object of this oommunicati<m is to hand you dupUcates 
of my several late despatches, say of 25th« 27th. and 31st Ultimo, the 
originals of which, with their respective enclosures, were forwarded 
to Vera Cruz to go pr Creole and Kathleen for N. Orleans (sailed 4th. 
inst.) That of 27th. March was in time while those of 25tli. (with 
its enclosure) and 31st. Ulto were three hours too late. 

As it is uncertain when an opportunity will again offer to send 
them forward. I hasten to transmit herewith duplicates of those de- 
tained (as well as that which went forward) /or, altho' they are not 
very important, yet without them the chain of Events is not complete, 
and the narrative of my progress is thus interrupted. 

The threatened disturbance of the tranquility of the Capital and 
apprehension of some Military Movement against the Gk>vmt. to 
which I referred in my last passed off without any result, the Gtovmt. 
having taken active and timely precautions and made some arrests, 
which effectually put a Stop to whatever, may have been contem- 
plated. All now is quiet, and the Govmt Stronger and more Secure 
than before in ccmsequence of this event Another event of scMne im- 
portance which will Serve to Strengthen the present Ministry is the 
defeat of Canales by Arista at Morelos on the 24th. and 25Ui. Ulto 
and almost Entire dispersion (as r^)orted officially) of his forces. 

It will probably be some time before Canales can rally and mean- 
time the Ministry feel themselves safe Enough. 

Mean/while^ I have heard nothing further in relation to the changes 
in the Cabinet to which I adverted in one of my last. In proporticm 
as the Administration gains strength, the less their hurry to get away. 

Campeche Still holds out against the Revolutionists of the Capital 
(Merida) among whose leaders dissentions are Said to Exist, which 
may defeat their plan of reducing Campeche, and thus enable the 
Govmt. to restore the whole l^epartmen^ to order again. 

Thus you see that comparitively small matters bring about im- 
portant results hercj and it may be affirmed that at no time foi^ two 
or three Months has the Grovemmt felt themselves more at ease than 
now. 

These facts are stated only because they effect my Negotiations, 
for the Govmt is timid or bold just in proportion to its weakness or 
its Strength, 

Hence, I congratulate myself in the hope that the Govmt. will 
remain, for this Tear at least, without change, and that they may 
continue to gain Strength, for in this in part I place my hopes of 
Ultimate Success, in the objects you had in view, in charging me 
with this important and delicate trust.

OOBBESPOKDEKGB WITH MEXICO. 603 

Since my last respects, I have had another interview with Mr. 
Canedo at his Department in which nothing new or interesting Speci- 
ally occurred. The Secretary, however, among other Matters, re- 
iterated his assurances that he was doing all in his power to place my 
propo9itionSy (as well as the whole Texas question) on the best possible 
footing with the Cabinet, and also with the Executive Counsel, who 
mm^ have to act in the premises before the Cabinet decides on any 
given course. That the delay which had occurred was desirable, that 
he might have time to confer with some of the leading men in the 
Council, before the Matter was finally discussed and disposed of. And 
that the Matter in general wore a more favourable aspect than before, 
and that he hoped by Trvaarhogement, (which might involve s(»ne little 
delay) he should be able to bring about some favourable result, tho' it 
might riM be what / so much wished, a Recognition, 

This interview was, like the preceding ones, conducted with the 
same apparent candour and frankness and was closed by expressing a 
wish that my advices from you, credentials, etc, might soon arrive, as 
tfi,at circum^^noe might give an impulse to the negotiation which was 
desirable, and might accelerate action and effect favourably the de- 
cision of Qovmt., if in time to produce its anticipated effect before the 
Cabinet had definitively acted oa the Subject. 

I told the Secretary that he might consider himself fully authorized, 
to retard final action, if he thought it under all circumstances desir- 
able and, in fact, to conduct and Manage the Matter with his Col- 
leagues according to his views of Expediency ; as /, of course, was not 
so demrous to bring the Matter to an issue as to wish to have the 
Matter pressed f<M^ard and closed under adverse circumstances; but 
that, on the contarary, I wished the subject to have all the contingent 
and incidental advantages which could be thrown in its way, and for 
this purpose he should carry on the negotiation to an issue 4» he 
thought proper. 

Subsequently to this* interview, mj/ principal friend and C^^per- 
ator, (Sd3-Ko6a) reported to me that he had just had a long and final 
interview with Mr. Cuevas, the Secretary of the Interior, (who had 
been Anti-T^sais in the offset and finally began to Vacillate) and that 
this Gentleman had become entirely convinced of tv>a important facts 
as regards the Texas question, viz — that it was not in the power of 
Mexico (without enormous Sacrifices) to recover Texas, and hence, 
that So soon as the Govmt. can make any honorable and amicable 
arrangement, it Should do So. 

This is a Cabinet Vote, and therefore an important one, for if 
Almonte and Echeverria (of the Treasury) Should go togethw there 
would be a tie, and this would Send the matter to the Council, where 
/ hope there will be a majority in favour of some immediate action.

604 AMBBICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIOK. 

I reported this to Mr. Pakenham and desired him to See both Mr 
Cdaiedo and Mr CuevoB opportunely, which he has recently done, and 
informs me that he asked Mr Cuevas his candid opinion and his reply 
fully confirmed J the Report of my friend^ That he, found Mr Canedo 
in good Spirits and that he Stated that Matters were progressing 
More favourably than he had at first anticipated, and that my proposi- 
tion would Soon be acted upon, and altho' it was probable that a 
Recognition at present would not be acceded to, yet that something 
would result from the deliberations of Gk)vmt. which he, the Secre- 
tary would duly communicate to Mr Pakenham etc etc etc. 

Thus you See, if the Secy, is playing a double game of Diploma<^ 
or deception, he is practising on Her Majesty^s Minister, as well as 
on your humble Confidential Agent; which / cannot of course, allow 
myself to believe, without some evidence equal to tha;t which induces 
the opposite opinion and belief. I refer merely to the Secretary's 
good faith in his professions etc etc, but it does not therefore follow 
that he will be able to carry his Views with the President, Cabinet 
or Council, but that he will do all in his power to produce the most 
favourable result obtainable, under the Existing circumstances. 
Time must however, decide this question. 

I thought under all the circumstances I should like to see the 
Secretary myself, and called on him Yesterday, but found [him] 
at the Bar of the Chamber of Deputies, where he had been called to 
explain an official Circular, emanating from his Department, declar- 
ing as Piratical the flag and Vessel armed by the Rebel authorities 
of Tucatcm. But, as was anticipated the Secretary came off tri- 
umphantly, the opposition having entirely failed in their objects. 

It is now doubtful if I see him before I close this communication, 
nor do I think it of much importance. As every thing Seems now to 
be moving as well as can be expected, if not as weU as might be 
desired. 

I am anxiously awaiting the next post from Tampico, to arrive 
Monday 13th. inst, in the earnest hope and expectation that I shall 
have advices from Govmt. pr the Schooner Doric, arrived at Tampico 
1st. inst. from N. Orleans in Six days passage. This information 
comes up by an Express while the correspondences is coming along 
slowly by mail. 

I hope I may not be disappointed on this occasion. If I am, I 
hardly know what Mr Canedo and Mr Pakenham will think, as it 
is now Seventy days since my letters of about the 1st. february went 
forward, wJdch I trust will have been considered as entitled to an 
immediate reply. 

A few days will decide whether, I am to be disappointed. 

I remark that Mr Pakenham has transmitted to his Govmt. every 
thing which has taken place here in regard to the action of this

Govmt. on the Texas question^ and also sent home copies of all the 
papers I have presented to the Secretary of State, as well as copies 
of Gen. Hamilton's two letters to Mr. Pakenham, and the reply 
of Mr P. to the first of said letters. I therefore suggest that this 
fact, might be communicated by the Department of State to Gen. 
Hamilton, (if he has Embarked) for his Government, so that he can 
Jcnow^ thro' Lord Palmerston, the State of things here by Every 
Mexican Packet that arrives. 

Of course^ any information of importance SJiould be conununi- 
cated to Gren. H. independently^ via N. York^ as it would Very Often 
anticipate the reception of Same intelligence hence direct. 

I have received nothing from Gen. Hamilton since he left N. 
Orleans for the North; his last bearing date 3d. Jany* last nor have 
I written him since 20th feburary, which was at length and for- 
warded in duplicate. 

The Treaty between Texas and France as published in your papers 
has been republished here in Several papers of the opposition^ as well 
as in the official of Govmt. but in Every instance without a word of 
conunent I furnished the Secretary of State with a copy, and he 
at once directed it to appear in the Govmt. paper, the tendency of 
which will be favourable. 

Mr. DeLisUe^ the former french Charge d* Affaires here^ leaves in 
a few days, for V. Cruz, Havana and New York. So it appears he 
does not Visit Texas, as he originally contemplated. I take the 
liberty to suggest that it would perhaps be as well that my corre- 
spondence should be kept loithin Your Cabinet for the present^ and 
until I reach the terminati(m of my mission, as continued secrecy may 
be desirable to this Govmt.^ as well as to yours^ until your negotia- 
tions with Mexico should be brought to some definite point.

COBBESPONDENOB WITH MEXICO. 607 

The Secretary has privately and confidentially, informed [me of] 
the course he is desirous to give to this Negotiation. He will call a 
Special cabinet Council to discuss the matter in question and place 
before it all the papers in relation thereto, advocating some action in 
the premises as Strongly as he can (without losing the Support of the 
President and his colleagues) he will press the Cabinet to pass the 
papers and whole Subject to the OouncU of the Oovemment fcft its 
opinion. 

If the Council recomm^id any action wiUi a View to faring the ne- 
gotiation to Some point, And the Cabinet (thus supported by the 
opinion of the Council) shall determine to go forward in the Matter, 
they will then appeal to the Legislature for the necessary autharisKh 
tion and powers to carry out such an amicable arrangement as the 
Govmermt, May think proper to make with the Govmt of Texas. 

If we cannot get the Vote in thds case, it may be because the cham- 
bers will not trust the Government with the entire negotiation, but 
may wish to fix Some general hoses for the action of the Goverrimoit. 

Congress may also grant the full powers to treat eorulitioned that 
the terms and Stipulations shall be submitted for approval before the 
Govmt. can close any Treaty. 

The application to Congress, if made, and their Action will be in 
Secret Session, and my Mission will still be continued a Secret, and 
myself incognito, as regards my Agency. 

Thus, you see exactly how matters now Stand, and the various 
ordeals through which the question must pass before we reach any 
final result. 

It is sufficiently obvious that if Congress will authorize [it], the 
Govemmt, will act, and I think promptly. 

If the matter Suceeds with the Cabinet and Council and reaches 
Congress, I shall have Some hopes of Success, for I have So arranged 
matters that I can cause some infiuence there myself, if necessary. 

TMs however, is the favourable side of the picture. I must See 
what the Secretary will Say to my proposition, (already forwarded 
you and marked A) and whether our plans work as we desire. 

We must await the issue, as any opinions in advance would be 
worth but very little. 

The letter I have received from the Dept. of State is Very Satis- 
factory, but it is entirely silent as regards any new or modified 
instructions in conformity to the Views of Gten. Hamilton, as com- 
municated to Mr. P. (Pakenham,) and myself, both before and after 
his last Visit to Texas. I have adverted to this point on Several 
occasions, and as far back as my Respects of 20th. and 81st Decem- 
ber; and more fully, under date of Jany. 18th.; and Still more at 
length in my despatch of 15tb, February.

Mr. Pakenham, has been of opinion (and Still is, tho' not so 
strongly as heretofore) that you will not obtain your Recognition on 
this jfirat attempt ; but that some preliminary arrangement might be 
entered upon, such as an Armistice for a given time, within which 
the Mexican Govmt. would agree to prepare itself for a full Recog- 
nition, and consequent Treaty of Peace, Commerce, Limits etc. 

This would be somewhat in accordance with Gen. Hamiltons views 
and Ideas, and what I wish to know is whetJter these are the Views 
of Your Grovmt, and how far (if a^ all) I am to act in accordance 
with them. My previous letters are so full and explicit that I refer 
you to them, and cannot doubt but I shall Soon receive Some infor- 
mation touching these points So necessary for my Grovmt. if I fail in 
my pending application and plans. 

I also take leave to remark that the letter referrd. to from the 
Dept. of State contained not a word about funds to my order in New 
Orleans. See my requests in letter of 31st december and subsequent 
ones. 

Awaiting with anxious Solicitude, the Action of the Cabinet here'j 
and also the receipt of your further advices^ I close with a pr<Mnise 
to advise You the moment anything of Mcwnent occurs.

to, owing to their rekiticmfi with Mexico. You are aware no doubt 
from mj previous letters that war has been declared against Texas 
and that some time since the troops marched from here Pueblo Vera 
Cruz etc. to Monterey Matamoras and Tampico in order to embody 
near the Bio Grande, and as soon as a Sufficient number is collected 
with sufficient equipments to march into Texas. Troops to this day 
are Gathering from various parts of the Republic and marching to 
the Eio Grande country. The army is at present estimated at Ei^t 
thousand Infantry and borne and daily Augmenting, and the Con- 
gress has passed a direct law authorizing the Government to draw one 
million of Dollars from the Marine Customs to defray in part [ex- 
penses] in the Texas war. The same law authorizes the Government 
to lay a war tax of 6:^ cts monthly on each individual of the Republic 
to be collected monthly during the said war, Counting 8000000 of 
souls we have a monthly tax of at least (throwing away one half) 
$250000. 

Mudi time has been and is taken up by both houses relative to this 
interesting Country (Texas) and it is too rich a prize they think to 
be lost without an effort 

I have understood that a Mr Treat of this place was authorized to 
make a proposition in behalf of Texas, and that Toledo was engaged 
as the Texas emissary, that Texae had offered $8000000 — ^report from 
a private source says that said Minister offered $4000000, expect'g to 
keep the balance if Accepted. This may not be true, but be it as it 
may, Texas if she has offered this sum is very blind in so doing — ^if 
she would know anjrthing of the present State of this Country she 
would be convinced that this money would be thrown to the winds 
and [. . .<»] mass of people composing various parties who would 
Only laugh at a law of recognition made by an opposite party in 
power today and removed from their seats on the morrow 

If the Centralists were to recognize that Country from the best 
motives possible, and to the greatest welfare of the Country, the 
opposite party would take an advantage of the same, raise the hue 
and cry of Treachery, and the consequence would be a general Revolu- 
tion It is more than the Centrals dare do, in the present state of 
affairs to recognize Texas. 

Lord Palmerston of England, some time since in a private letter 
to the Mexican Minister of Foreign affairs in this City, Canedo writes 
thus or to the same amount " if you do hot recognize Texas we shall " 
Canedo answered that they were in no mood to recognize Texas, and 
that he must not think that they had abandoned the Country, but 
were making every preparation in their power to retake it.

The press I am sorry to inform You is no longer free, and no 
political question can ^hereafter be discussed under very heavy 
penalties, so that you can no longer receive news from the Public

The Act of the freedom of the press has been thought to be 
injurious to the Republic owing to its giving intdligence to the enemy 
of the movements t)f the Army Government, etc This was set on 
foot by Canedo the Minister of Foreign relations. 

A part of the lands on the Rio Grande have been given to the 
English as Collateral security. 

The French Minister has informed me that France is disatisfiedA 
with Baudin's Treaty. I presume that you are aware that France J 
has recognized the Independence of Texas. ^ 

Genl. Santa Anna has asked for a passport to leave the Country 
for Columbia etc and obtained it without any difficulty. 

The Small pox is making its Usual ravages in this City. 

The Spanish Minister has lately Arrived and was received in 
Great pomp, and a ball given on the occasion — ^you must not be sur- 
prized if Mexico does not throw her self under the Spanish pro- 
tection. 

Mexico now trembles to the very centre — foreseeing that her tawny 
sons and daughters must eventually fall. The Americans it is very 
plain to be seen must people the Country — ^Mexico must either come 
under the Yoke of a Foreign nation or be lost entirely, her external

Sir, 

Conceiving that the foregoing letter contains matter both interest- 
ing and of an important bearing upon the Policy, Safety, and Welfare 
of Texas, (although not to be sure of very recent date) I have con- 
cluded to send you the copy complete, in order that you may be better 
able by having the whole, to judge of the value of the information, 
(although that part of it in relation to Mr Treat, in my opinion is 
not Worthy of Consideration — and I should not send the copy thus 
entire but in the full belief that it will be treated as strictly Con- 
fidential, and if preserved be placed in the Secret Archives of the 
State Department. The author is a Gentleman whose acquaintance 
I made in Mexico when there as the late Agent of Texas, and who I 
engaged to keep me informed of movements there.

This delay enables me to hand you a despatch from Mr Pakenham 
to Your Dept. of State^ in answer to the one recently received by 
Mr P. from Judge Burnet. 

My formal call on the Secretary of State by his Special Note of 
invitation took plac^ yesterday^ [at] which, being purely a matter 
of form^ nothing occurrd. of any moment. The Secretary said he 
should Soon have the papers ready to place before the Cabinet, when 
he should endeavour to give the business the course already indicated, 
in my respects of 21st. inst herewith. 

We must now await quietly a few days, until I know, the faie of 
the question, on the part of the Cabinet, which may he indicative of 
the intentions of Government; cmd which I will report upon, with- 
out a moment's imnecessary delay, for your further Government and 
Satisfaction. 

I reported, in a former Communication, that the Bill So long 
pending before Congress to provide Ways^ and Means for the recov- ' 
ery of Texas was finally lost in tlie Senate. This was true^ and I 
supposed was final and decicive of the fate of the meamcre. But it 
appears, (as these people have a way in almost every thing peculiar 
to themselves.) the Secretary of War re-urged the Matter, the Com- 
mittee of the House a^am took up the Subject, and reported a new 
Billj with Some alterations, and it is now under discussion in the 
House, and its provisions approved of by that body, up to the 7th 
^'Article of the project.'*^ 

It is generally believed that it will pass the Deputies, and as gen- 
erally thought that the Senate will reject it. A few days will 
decide. 

I asked the Secretary of State yesterday whether the passage of 
that BUI would not interfere with hds plans^ and those of the Cabinet, 
to which he replied in the negative. Said he, in the first place, the 
bill, in my opinion, will not pass; and, if it should, it may be con- 
sidered a dead Letter^ so far as Texas is concemd* 

This confirmed my previous opinion that the Revenue Contem- 
plated by it is wanted for oth^er purposes. As the bill now stands, 
the Govmt. can apply the proceeds of the Revenue to the Restoration 
of Texas; the Protection of the frontiers from Indian depredations] 
or may distribute it, at discretion, among the Departments. 

So that there is nothing, scarcely, in Said bill, which has any bear- 
ing on Texas, except its Title. My friends will stop it, nevertheless, 
in the Senate, if they can^ as it will have a good effect on the Cabinet 
as regards my direct progress. 

April 25th. Evening. Since writing the foregoing, I have seen 
Mr Caiiedo, and also Mr. Pakenham. The former, told me that, on 
the 27th. inst, he should open my affair to the Cabinet, and he thought 
things looked well.

Mr Pakenham, since I saw him, has sent me his Letter (open) to 
the Hon. Judge Burnet^ instead of to the Hon the Secretary of State, 
as I had, vnthout re-flection^ supposed. 

You are of course wed aware that Mr. P cannot address himself 
ofjlcidlly^ nor give any cffioial titles of Recognition, in his letters to 
any public functioT^ary^ where the country is not recognized by Ms 
Sovereign. Hence the Style of the letter herewith. He requested 
me to make this remark, altho', it [is] obvious that no exception 
could be taken. I think the contents quite Satisfactory. You will 
therefore I trust, look over the Expressions of ^*'Gen LaTnar'^ and

Snt, 

I have had the honour to receive from the hands of Mr. James 
Treat your letter of the 12th. March; and I am much gratified to 
find from it that the steps taken by me, in fulfilment of the instruc- 
tions of Her Majesty's Grovemment, towards effecting an arrange- 
ment between this Country and Texas, have been viewed with satis- 
faction by the Texian Authorities. 

The difficulties which had existed with regard to the recognition 
of Mr. Treat as Agent for Texas having been removed by the full 
power lately transmitted to him, he will now possess the advantage 
of communicating freely and directly with the Mexican Government ; 
and it will afford me sincere pleasure to txmtinue to cooperate with 
him whenever he may think my assistance desirable. . 

I have to request that you will be pleased to present my respects 
to Greneral Lamar, and to accept the assurance of the high considera-

it is said, to Santa- Annas return here as Commandtuite Greneral of 
this "placa." The present Commandante, General Don Francisco 
de Paula Taro, of Vera Cruiz who is brother in law to Santa Anna, 
will then of course be Teniente General or Second in Command. 
Santa Anna is however delicate in health and is at his Estancia 
(Farm) some thirty miles from Vera Cruz, but I have my doubts 
about his being in a delicate State of health, owing to private Con- 
versations overheard. Some Strangers (Merchants) say they have 
their doubts as to his returning to Vera Cruz, and I have been unable 
to learn particulars, as every thing is kept within the knowledge of 
the few. The mass of the people are a conglomerated mass of colour 
and as ignorant as they are mixed. When I arrived there were several 
French men of war here, but they were only awaiting some of the 
Government Claims. They received Two hundred thousand dollars, 
which Cost the Mexican Government (it is said) near half a Million 
to raise it. These Vessels of war have left and there is nothing 
here but a small English packet lately frcMn Tampico, and two other 
english vessels of war lying off. 

Bustamente has taken the Presidential Chair in Mexifco, not I 
presume with the good wishes of Santa Anna, but owing to the will 
of the leading Characters of the various juntas who are at the head 
of Government in Mexico. General Filasola is said to be at present 
in the City of Mexico. He is one of the instigators of war against 

^ but at present his influence is not to be Considered. Santa 

Anna it is rumored has not yet lost his ambitious Spirit but walks 
erect with his artificial foot and thinks he is as able to Command an 
army or Conduct a campaign as he ever was, and no doubt is looking 
forward to another Revolution in his favor. Thousands are Said to 
be on the eve of raising the hue and cry of " Viva Santa Ana " 

You may shortly expect not an invasion of but of the City of 

Mexico. The account published in the New Orleans [Commercial] 
Bulletin of the 11th and 13th of July of the sixty Thousand men 

having been called for, to march against the Republic of was 

correct, and it appears that some few men have been raised for that 
pTurpose, but some were dismissed under certain conditions, and for 
the present as far as I can learn the expedition is postponed, some 
say until January, others who have some knowledge of the movements 
say that the sixty thousand men are to be raised to defend the va- 
rious Mexican ports and not to invade Texas. But one thing is cer- 
tain that Sixty Thousand men have been ordered to be raised, in 
order to retake and the opinion of the people here is that

will be envaded, and I give you in confidence the American 

Consul as one of my informants, and I am convinced that it is the 
intention of the Government at present; but when or how they can 
accomplish their end in view, God only knows. 

1st. Their treasury is empty, their credit is bad, their paper worth 
not over fifty Cents in the dollar, was given payable in the Custom 
House in this City (Vera Cruz). 

2nd. Who shall take Charge of the troops? Jealousy stalks 
abroad in the Country, and who can be trusted? None, he who com- 
mands the army may command Mexico. But take away the army, 
and up springs a petty tyrant, and with the voice of the Babble puts 
himself at the head of the government 

3rd. It is true there arrived here two cargoes of ammunition, and 
three more are expected, but such was the State of affairs here, that 
they had not money enough to pay the caravans to take it to Mexico.* 
It was however taken to the City. It is also reported, that Mexico 
has made a requisition, in England for a large Stock of arms, which 
are shortly expected. Some however doubt the validity of the re- 
port; but let not this sink into the minds of the ^ even if it 

should prove true; these arms will only be put into the hands of walk- 
ing statutes, who will only use them in a measure mechanically or 
by force destitute of that invigorated spirit which influences and 
propels the true Patriot to take up th^ cause and fight for his Coun- 
try. They also talk of Calling for Volunteers, in order they say, 
to make a general feeling predominate throughout the Camp, and 
Country, that of a universal wish for the extermination of the 
"Rebels and Pirates! " ''Who against the laws of all Nations have 
taken possession of the CourUry^ may be exterminated ! But when 
I think of the soldiers of this country who scarcely ever receive their 
pay, who are sadly clad, and have often to travel without shoes, [it] 
makes me of the opinion that a third who start for the Republic 

of will never be able to reach it, and those who do will be so 

much enfeebled by bad treatment tuid long marches that a thou- 
sand may drive Ten Thousands of them from their Shores by 

good management and regular discipline. I would say more, but 
as I leave in the morning for Jalapa and from thence to Pueblo, and 
thence for the Capitol, think it prudent to wait until I can give 
something more Certain but give you to understand that it is my 

opinion that — ^ will not be invaded for some twelve months to 

come. 

I am dear Sir Your Very humble Servt.

618 AMEBICAK HT8TORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Mexico Cmr November 10th. 18S9. 
Deae Sie, 

I have postponed writing dnring the last two months, owing to 
my being unable to procure correct information relative to the impor- 
tant object, for which I came to this Country, and further the great 
hazard of my letters falling into the hands of the enemy before th^ 
could reach the Coast, not only from the hundred spies of the govern- 
ment, but from the various partidos of FederalistoSj who bent cm 
revenge, still scour the plains in search of News and plunder. Some- 
times the highway is interrupted by gangs of fifty of those despera- 
does who sally from the Mountains or ravines undw the mask of 
brigands, drive off whole Caravans without respect to person or prop- 
erty ; add to these, the professed brigands who infest the Country in 
every direction, and you may form some idea of the ri* of oonvey- 
«nce of private or Common business letters from the interior of this 
Republic. But having returned to this City from a tour through the 
Northern part of Mexico, I shall be able from time to time to write 
whatever of information or of interest that I may be able to procure, 
relative to that which most interests a patriotic heart in the welfare 
of his Country. 

1st. A concise view of Mexico at present so far as my information 
extends, stands thus. Chihuahua City with a little upwards of 
twenty thousand inhabitants, stands at present at a very low ebb; 
its police broken up for the want of money and of confidence ; The 
various partidos have not only rendered miserable the citieens of the 
City, by their various broils and bloody skirmishes, but the whole 
state with 180,000, inhabitants from causes of a similar kind have 
been rendered very miserable, ^tting aside other evwrts if possible 
still more distressing. %th. of this people are Indians, poor, miser- 
able beings, that drag out life in a truly wretched State; domineered 
over by the more superior class of Mexicans, who are generally natives 
bom but descendants of Spain. Add to the above, the drou^t of tiie 
past season, during which many died of hunger, hundreds swept off 
by the small pox, their villages plundered, and many of the male 
inhabitants murdered, females who could not escape, ravished, and 
carried off on various occasions by the « tribes of the north. 

Groaning under various acumulations of Misery, again and repeat- 
edly they have applied, to the Head Department for assistance, that 
their frontiers might be guarded; Congress full of other matters; 
political villainies lurking, in every quarter has been unable to allevi- 
ate this more than wretched state, until the people are almost driven 
to desperation, and had they the means and intelligence necessary 
they would form a petty government of their own. As respects the 
feelings of this people in general, it is hostile to Texas, but there ar«

some of the leading characters of the Federal party who pretend to 
be friends with Texas, not openly, but from a private source (and in 
confidence) have I learned the Same. But I would not have you lay 
too much confidence upon the friendship proposed by those who skirt 
the Eio Grande, and « nearly to Rio Nueces, some of those, I 

have learned, have made propositions to the Government of Texas; 
be Alert^ be aware ^ of treachery ; the same proposals have been made 
to the Centrals (who are now in power) by the same individuals, 
proposing to lay aside their national quarrel for the present, and join 
as a patriotic body in the explusion of a foreign enemy. Be aware of 
Canales, he has called on the Mexican Govrmt. for assistance to 
drive the Texians from their post on the Rio Nueces. (Casa Blanca 
or White House) he no doubt has called on Texas in the same way, 

Durango — ^The affairs of state in the District of Durango, bear a 
much better aspect than the last mentioned, and I find the people to 
be of a much more active class of beings. It and Coahuola are almost 
the same; they are scratching together ways and means to assist 
Tamaulipas to drive the Texians off the Rio Nueces; Durango, Zaca- 
tecas and New Leon would shew much patriotic feeling for Mexico, 
and hatred towards Texas; in fact the great majority of the leading 
men, on Rio Grande, are far from recognizing the independence of 
Texas, and in this Country, the voice of the few wield the will and 
sentiments of the thousands of the motley crowd. However, want 
of money and party spirit is a great annoyance to the enemies of 
Texas. The want of confidence.^ 

The Central part of Mexico, is tranquil as respects party Spirit 
I can hardly say the same of the Southern Coast, of the Mexican 
Bay, nor of the Pacific: Many of the Citizens of these districts are 
not content. But nothing serious is apprehended. A declaration 
in favor of Santa Ana, at most, A feeble attempt of the Kind was 
lately made by Genl. Urrea, but, poor fellow, after suffering much 
of anxiety for the completion of his plans, he was taken prisoner ten 
days since, under an assumed name in a convent of Guadalahara. 

Having run over in haste the Country at large, giving you a 
hurried and faint sketch, I shall proceed more leisurely to give you 
the movements of the Head Department. In the meantime I would 
not have you forget, that a small force of enemies (and augment- 
ing) were uniting on the Rio Grande in May last, but doubt its end- 
ing in much. I informed you when in Vera Cruz about the first of 
August, that the great Army Spirit had in a manner ceased to exist, 
and that it was not likely that an army would or could be raised 
under Some ten months to go to Texas. I was, from what I have

learned since, not far wrong in my surmises. But, previous to my 
entering upon affairs of more weighty interest, I must inform you 
of what I learned of one of two principal officers under Grovemment 
One the Governor of Vera Cruz, the other a Colonel who had been 
in the Texian War with Santa Ana. This happened in a village 
called Santa Fe. The Colonel was a German. I, like Satan roving 
up and down the world was very anxious, from what I had overheard 
to ingratiate myself if possible with this Colonel; having watched 
my time, I pounced upon him in German, he replied in English; a 
long conversation ensued, and to my great surprize he informed me, 
amongst others, the following That the 60,000 men were now con- 
sidered unnecessary, as the enemy had left the Mexican ports, and 
that an Army would now be raised by Volunteers or draft, not 60,000 
but some 20 or 25 thousand men, to go against Texas, and he ex- 
pected to be one of the Officers. He said it would be some months 
first, before affairs could be regulated to equip a campaign. They 
were awaiting supplies of powder from the North — their arms were 
on the way from England, or had already arrived at the Custom 
House — ^that the intention of the Government was to have Steamboats 
or Schooners to carry the right wing of the Army, (he meant the 
troops that would be taken by sea) to the Coast of Texas; and that 
they intended, to have flat bottomed row-boats, by which the army 
could be landed under ambush by entering the inlets. They are all 
to be landed (said he) either by the mouth of the Nuices or Colorado 
rivers, as circumstances would permit and from what I have since 
learned he was correct. As I am persuaded an army will march 
next spring, if money can he raised by loan. 

Again, he informed me that Mwiterey, would be the depot ren- 
devous, Matamoras and Tampico would be the ports of embarcation, 
and that the troops destined to march would start direct for some 
point-on the Rio Grande ; he supposed the army in all would amount 
to 20,000. men. This, Dear Sir, I give you pretty much word for 
word as I then received it. (The conversation overheard is unneces- 
sary to relate here.) 

Head Department, Mexico City Nov. 18S9. 
Important; Congress is still in Session. Bustamente, President; 
and much time is occupied in both Camaras in Secret or private con- 
sultation. Two very important points take up much of the time 
employed in private Council: The first is to establish tranquillity 
throughout the Country by granting such privileges, and passing 
such laws, as shall be conducive to the happiness of the people, and 
carry with them the desired effect of leading over to the present 
power, the revolting spirit, that still stalks abroad in many of the 
frontier states. So far^ so good.

COBRESPONDENCB WITH MXXIOO. 621 

The Second, and no less important point of secret discussion is 
upon " the Ways and Means " best calculated to carry success, in the 
Betaking of Texas ! ! ! Too true to be a joke. Yes, dear Sir, I 
have had much difficulty in procuring this important fact, and with 
much risk to my personal safety. Thrice have I been announced as 
a suspicious person, but fortunately the information was so lame in 
every point, and the traitors (for such I must call them) not being 
able to prove anything, with shame fell short of their object (and 
this to make themselves popular with the Mexicans). The 1st. was 
« of Memphis, who saw me conversing with Col. Bee, and who 
came with me in the Same vessel. The second was who came 

with He has returned to Orleans, and intends to go to 

Texas to live; he is pock-marked, sandy complection, slender built, 
about 25 years of age. The 3d. I having learned that something not 
very favourable had escaped the lips of Mr. in reference to me, 

I obtained thereupon his word of honor (a puff of wind, his honor) 
that whatever he knew directly^ or indirectly, or by hearsay should 
be kept secret. And did he keep it? No Sir; like a low puppy, far 
beneath the character of any gentleman, his tongue was that of a 
Silly unthinking woman. A few days after this, a Mr. S of Philadel- 
phia, put me on my guard against Mr. . So much for this 
is still in this City; but as I have forewarned 
him of immediate death in case of another word, that I am somewhat 
persuaded that he will remain mute, as I am of the belief that I 
ought not to leave the country, until every thing is ripe for destruc- 
tion; which I have no doubt will be in March. / hope I may he 
wrong. 

But to proceed to the movements of the Deputados of the Camara, 
relative to the retaking of Texas. Perhaps in no country is it so 
hard to procure correct information as in this. Every pass, every 
link, every fibre that is made to compose the materiels of this brood- 
ing war have their origin around the midnight lamp, or in the retired 
fastness of Some appropriate room of Iturbide's palace — ^the Diarios 
(papers) of the day, are as silent upon this great outfit as the 
pyramidal tombs of the Emperors of the ancient Mexics. Thus, dear 
Sir, arises the great difficulty under which your Country, labors, you 
can have no correct or at least no important information, except 
from travellers, and they too often write from the spur of the 
moment. For instance, you may go aboard of a vessel from this 
Country, and enquire of the passengers, what news from Mexico? 
and no two will tell you the same story. One will say, all is quiet, 
and no efforts are making for war, because they speak from self 
formed opinions, or external appearances. The secret movements of

a political body Can only be obtained in Mexico by one who re- 
sides in the City and makes it his sole business for a time, for months, 
we may say, courting favor with those who are in the favor of the 
Courts. This has been my plan since I arrived in this City and 
Country, how far I may have been successful, time will tell. 

1st. Bustamente it seems, has been chosen as the leader of the Army 
about to be raised (Santa Ana will probably take the chair in his 
absence) or some other, it is not yet known I believe. 

2d. To raise men, a list of the young unmarried men, and widow- 
ers (without issue or children) and Bachelors, throughout all the 
Mexican territory has been made, as a proof of which I have seen a 
list of some 6,000 names residents of this city, out of each a certain 
number are to be drafted, I cannot give you the exact number. (The 
infantry and horse of this City already amounts to some 3,500.) The 
proclamation that I saw issued some time since to have the draft 
made throughout the States without fail was so carefully worded 
that the mass of the populace scarcely^ know the intention of the draft. 
The idea held out is an augmentation of the army to defend "Za 
Patria^'^ against her enemies, and for the better protection of her 
frontiers and coasts, which is the self and same thing, and likewise to 
replace various vacancies caused by the expired time of certain 
soldiers. 

This great draft will shortly be made in the form of a Lottery. 

2nd." To raise money to fit out a campaign with an empty Treas- 
ury? This I know has been harped abroad; that Mexico could do 
nothing for want of means; the Treasury, true is in a measure bank- 
rupt, but Congress anxious to lend whatever it can in so worthy a 
cause will vote for almost any act, that will be beneficial to the cause, 
and if I mistake not, a law already has been passed, authorizing the 
Government to borrow $800,000 ; but setting aside this sum ; Mexico 
has many very wealthy citizens who are ready at a moment to lend 
thousands upon thousands to defray the expenses of the war against 
Texas, and that, upon moderate terms of interest ; as a proof of what 
I say, I give you for example : At the time the French had taken Vera 
Cruz, an army was about to be raised here in Mexico, and that to be 
paid in part by Mexican citizens, when one man alone (Col. *) 

proposed to furnish 6,000 men ; therefore do not be deceived : Had 
not the French annoyed the Mexican's Coasts, an army would have 
been on foot long since ; thus when I was on the frontiers, the Coman- 
che Indians boasted of the great Mexican Army, which was to assist 
them against Texas ; I wrote the same to head-quarters. These same 
Indians, I have learned are growing impatient, and it is urged by 
those Spani^ii officers in Texas, that if the army is not soon on

the frontiers, tliat the Comandies may turn in favor of Texas, and 
thus one very important point of Country fall into the power of a 
wild and ferocious enemy, instead of having it guarded and defended 
by the same. Another Spur to the quick advancement of this con- 
templated expedition is the probable recognition of Texas by France. 
As it respects a recognition of Texas by Mexico, there is no hope at 
present. 

I am persuaded that the cry of honor and war must resound «nce 
more, when I hope (and not without grounds) they will be satisfied 
and be brought to terms. Guard well your Coasts, and let not the 
Country encounter the enemy unprepared. There is but one impedi- 
ment, that I know of at present, that may impede or frustrate the 
deigns of the present enemy; and that is should another revolu- 
tion take place in this Country. Again Mexico is aware of the rapid 
increase of Texas, and that if the blow is not struck soon, very soon, 
no hope of victory will remain. Oh ! deluded race of beings. Would 
it not be much better to come to terms of peace, than to risk anotiier 
war? House not again the lion's whelp, it has grown strong, and its 
power if exasperated further, may be felt beyond the Rio Grande. 
Yes, dear Sir, I am persuaded at the present state of affairs that 
3,000 well armed Texians, landed on the Rio Grande could lay waste 
the five principal states bordering west of said river. Again, Dear 
Sir, I urge you with all the powers of my soul, and at the risk of this 
communication, not to treat what I have here written with inatten- 
tion. I would not have you run the Country to any unnecessary ex- 
pense under present circumstances, but what I would wish you to 
understand is this, be on the alert, let the Government be in such a 
position as to be ready to act, and Supply means at a moment's warn- 
ing, in case the enemy does come. I shall remain until I am con- 
vinced of the certainty, in the meantime you will hear from me ; but 
I shall not cry '* To Arms," " To Arms " until I behold the enemy 
embodied in this country. Then by extraordinary express I will 
announce to you the Same. 

But I would not have you misconstrue my words; I mentioned in 
another page, of troops gathering in Tamaulipas, in New Leon, and 
in Coahuala ; this was set on foot in the forepart of Summer and I 
understand it was rather doubtful if it would amount to any thing 
serious. These were only intended to draw back the Texans, and not 
intended to make a general invasion. It would perhaps be well to 
spy out the Country between the Rio Grande and Nuices, but should 
troops be discovered in said part, it must be the business of said spy 
to ascertain for a certainty (if possible) if said troops be enemies or 
vanquished federals, who have only posted themselves there for se- 
curity ; in being thus careful much unnecessary expense and excite- 
ment may be avoided.

As respects El Sr. Canales, who tock refuge in Texas in April last^ 
you perhaps Know more of him, than I can inform you at present; 
it is supposed by sotne here that he has thrown himself upon that 
Country. As before mentioned, he proposed by letter to Genl. Cana- 
liso of Matamoras to join against Texas; the Genl. was suspicious, 
and did not think it prudent, either to accept or discard the offer, 
but proposed to a higher source, that it would be well to secure 
Canftles for a time, until the truth of his loyalty or villainy was de- 
termined. At present (November) from last accounts which I re- 
cieved direct from Matamoras and Tampico, State the amount of 
troops (under Genl. Canaliso) from «and adjoining States 

to amount to 2000 men, but it is presumed that these troops are not 
designed for foreign but internal purposes, namely, to keep down the 
Federal party. The Country therefore I have reason to believe is 
without any fbrmidable foe. A few stragling parties at most (I 
mean [in the] Rio Grande Coimtry). 

G^nl. Filosola is commander in chief (of the troops) in Mexico. 
Genl. Arista, is now in this city. Gen. Victoria is in Vera Cruz. 
Santa Ana, I believe, at his estate, near Vera Cruz ; he took with him 
when he left this city, in Gold $76,000! ! (Doubloons $1.216.000! !) 
and $300 over in Silver which he could not exchange here for gold. 
So much to be a president with power to make contracts for Govern- 
ment. 

I am Sir, Your Very obedt. Servt. 



Mexico Cmr Novr. 18th. 1839. 
Dear Snt 

I have no doubt you have considered the time long since I last wrote 
you, and perhaps thought strange of so much time elapsing without 
any intelligence directly or indirectly relative to Mexico. The truth 
is that I have wrote since I have been in the Republic several letters, 
and as often destroyed the same, owing to my having been misin- 
formed, and the great probability of my letters not reaching the 
Coast in Safety, my having been so far in the interior. Perhaps there 
is no country in which it is so hard to come at matter of fact as in this ; 
the great mass of beings that compose the population of this romantic 
and interesting region are far behind, as it respects intelligence of 
mind, in the advancement of knowledge, the Camanches, and Pawnee 
tribes, who have had their homes in the far western wilds out of the 
reach of civilization. The latter tribes averse to every species of 
domestication, still out- vie the Mexican Indians in almost every p>oint 
Three-fifths of the whole population of Meidco are Indians of the 
lowest order; they live in mud cabins, straw huts, under projecting 
banks or rocks, and many the wide canopy for a covering ; they live

these of course, Dear Sir, were not likely to give me any great in- 
formation of an interesting nature — and nothing correctly. 

Among the higher order of beings in this country is the only source 
from which, then, I have been able to procure any intelligence what- 
ever, matter of fact, or otherwise the Contrary ; and [I confess] that, 
as an important truth related to me one day has as often been contra- 
dicted on a succeeding day ; thus I have tome up my letters and burnt 
my notes, least* I should commit a fault in writing you that which 
was not correct. 

Much of the news published in your papers relative to this country 
is very erroneous, given by travellers who have been here, or who live 
here, who write from first sight, over excitement, or on the spur of the 
moment. You may therefore Dr. Sir, consider whatever news coming 
from the present source as having been well digested, not having 
come from a single blast of some noisy throat or whispering news-car- 
rier, but from a source that will carry a weight sufficient to justify at 
least the probability that I have hit the mark.

bad, and I believe worse abroad. 
However, She with England still 
has power to make loans at enor- 
mous rates; it is the only country 
to which she is able to apply for 
assistance. 

I find that by the consent of 
Congress, she may lease out cer-

enabled to receive [payment] in 
advance, or make loans when 
there can be found those who will 
lend her money. 

Only by solvent security. 



I have been informed that when 
the country is invaded or likely 
to be so by a foreign enemy that 
among the patriotic rich are to 
be found those who are willing to 
lend assistance upon very moder- 
ate terms. For instance, had the 
Frendi continued their march into

young men — throughout the Republic, and that a draft be made 
from said number in order to replenish the Army with troops 
sufficient to defend "La Patria" against her enemies". In this 
City already has appeared posted on the comer of the Streets, [a list] 
of three thousand names taken in this City; they are printed in 
alphabetical order, commencing at A, and the list reaches down to H, 
from which I judge that the whole list must contain in all 6000 names. 
Out of this the draft is to be made. The proportion I know not. It 
is in accordance not with the act of Santa Ana (of 60,000) but of the 
more moderate plan, I presume of Congress. I am informed that 
they intend to carry the Army in part by Steanboats with scows to 
the mouth of the Nuices, or between that and Rio Grande, or near 
the mouth of Colorado, and land the men with the small boats along 
the unfrequented coast of Texas, and thus take the country by sur- 
prise; Matamoras and Tampico will be the posts of embarcaticm ; 
there will also at the same time or previous march an army from Mon- 
terey or thereabouts by land to some point on Rio Grande, and from 
thence to Texas in order to meet if possible, near the same time those 
embarked by Sea. (If steamboats cannot be obtained. Coasting ves- 
sels will be employed instead.) Now should nothing impede this 
grand effort of Mexico, you may expect the arrival in Texas, of the 
enemy about the 1st of May when those noble sons of that little star 
will have to wake up, and try another San Jacinto battle, or receive 
their fate like unto the vanquished of that day.

QuestioDs. AoBweiB. 

But you can give me your opin- I hinted above that she was not 
ion. What will Mexico gain by taking the right step. I believe 
this war or what will she lose, or that she will fail in her object, 
in other words will she prove vie- that is, she will get whip't. pro- 
torious, or will she be vanquished? viding the Texans prepare in 

time, keep united and do not fly 
the country : she must not pounce 
or rush upon the en^ny at once or she will be overpowered, but 
she must fall back, retreat, reconoitre, and again retreat. In this 
way they may torment their enemy until their provisions grow 
scarce, and their Cavalry be diminished, their Soldiery become tired, 
when they (the Texans) may make a successful rush upon the enemy, 
gain an eternal victory over their Mother foe. Such an event will 
be the immediate recognition of Texas by Mexico. But why should 
I be writing to you so much about Mexico and Texas? You surely 
canH have much interest for either party^ and as for myself y you 
know that I am averse to aJl kinks of politics and political move- 
ments. I must tell you something else. 

Mexico City is well built, solid in its structure and beautified with 
numerous palaces, with three hundred towers. 

Situated in a valley of the clouds, in a tropical climate^ where man 
feels neither heat nor cold, two hundred thousand souls, within its 
bounds, live, move, and breathe ; the rich in Coaches roll their usual 
rounds through favorite grounds in careless ease. The aspiring mer- 
chant, and the industrious of the medium class only bear affinity 
with the customs of an American City ; fifty thousand souls of native 
Mexican blood daily crowd the Streets in search of food, for which 
some in errands pay, some with trivial toys made of rags, or wood 
or potters clay; ten thousand more, like Naples Lazaroni, crown 
around the portals of convents, kneel, and under arches stand and 
along the frequented streets and walks, bend their way supplicating 
each passer-by in accents of pitying woe (by practice learned to per- 
fection's point, showing some a withered hand, or crippled foot, or 
deformed limb, or disgusting sore or some framed excuse) for a 
Medio, (6^ cents) to buy them bread, which when obtained, [they 
go] direct to some pulky « shops (where a kind of beer is sold) and 
scarcely leaving a fourth for bread. 
This, Dr. Sir, is the State of Mexico.

the villages of the country were

and its attendant consequences, and you may form some idea of their 
condition, without a police, driven to a state of desperation they have 
applied to Government in no very supplicatory terms for some imme- 
diate amelioration of their Sufferings (having often stated their 
wrongs without being heard). 

The country from Chiuhuachua, South, has not suffered so much 
from drougth etc. as the above, but the whole country down to the 
Sea Coast has been in a measure ruined, by the revolution, and at 
present, but little of interest is going on. Genl. Canalesio of Mata- 
moras has under his command some 2,000 Men, in order to keep down 
the Federals. He applied in May last for an increase of troops to 
drive the Texians from Casa hlanca (White House) on Rio Nuices 
(Nut River) but I cannot learn of anything having been done. 

Some of the Federals I have been informed, applied * to that coun- 
try (some six hundred) between Rio Grande and Nut River; whether 
to live with the Indians or with the Texians I cannot inform you; 
likewise, one whose name is Canales, at the head of about 1000 men, 
also of the Federal party took refuge in that Country. The same 
wrote to the General at Matamoras (Caneliso) proposing to lay down 
their quarrel, and as true Mexicans, join and drive the Texans off of 
their post at Casa hlanca. Mexico doubting of his sincerity did not 
accede, but concluded not to persecute him further. Genl. Canaliso 
of Matamoras wrote here, that Canales had made the same overtures 
to the Texans, perhaps you Bjiow more of this matter than I can 
inform you; I believe therefore that this constitutes the troops on 
Rio Grande. Spanish officers are still roving over the Texian fron- 
tiers, seeking friendship with the wild Indians, and frequently writ- 
ing to this Government to hurry on with an Army, least « the Caman- 
ches should grow tired in waiting, and turn in favor of Texas.

Notes, etc. 

" I can give you nothing of what may occur here, as the news has 
just arrived; this immediate declaration of war has been set on foot 
(much sooner than I anticipated) by Canales and Zapata joining 
Texas, and they are apprehensive that Texas will make a rush upon 
Matamoras." 

Mexico, (Important). Nov. 19 10. oVlock. P. M. 1839. 
Deab Sm, 

I in haste send you this slip, declaring to you that an immediate 
invasion will be made upon Texas; I have received dates from Mata- 
moras, bearing date 8th. Novr. Genl. Canaliso, on Sunday called on 
the inhabitants to raise to arms. The Alcalde likewise has sent out 
a proclamation, and the whole Rio Grande Country West has been 
supplicated in the name of God, and the Salvation of the Country to 
turn out en masse to go against that Republic. Awake ! The hour 
has come. The War dogs Come ! The. regular troc^s are only 2000. 
Yours etc. 

Note, 19th, Evening. (Important.) I have just reed, intelligence 
from Matamoras, that Canales has joined Texas, and said letter says 
it is more than probable that a great part of the Federal party on 
Rio Grande will declare for Texas, but more of this to-morrow. 

Note of 19th — I received a letter this morning from Zacatecas stat- 
ing that an attempt in that City was made a few days since by the 
Federal party, to commence again the Revolution. (Jenl. Urrea has 
been taken prisoner in Guadalajara some fifteen days since; some 
say he is to be brought to Mexico to be hanged, others that he has 
already arrived ; others say, he is on his way to Vera Cruz, to be ban- 
ished ; nothing is certain as to his fate or where he is. He has no 
doubt been taken prisoner. 

Note 19th. — A writer from Vera Cruz informs me that it is feared 
that Matamoras and Tampico stand good chance to fall into the 
hands of the Texians. 

Note. 19th. The net proceeds of customs in Matamoras has amounted 
(it is said) to near $300,000 ; solely from fifteen vessels. 

Four hundred houses in the city of Chiahuahchua « were destroyed 
solely by overflow. 

Note 19th. A considerable stir is still making in order to unite the 
people against a foreign foe, setting aside party quarrels. 

Look out! Mexican Spies in Texas! ! 

I find that a private correspondence is Kept up between Texas and 
Mexico. 

General Caneliso of Matamoras received regular accounts of the 
movemnts of Texas.

Lipscomb to Hamilton.* 

BxFUBuc OF Texas, Deft State 

A'a»tin 4th May 1840 
To Grenl James Hamilton 
Sib, 

In reviewing the communication of 24th Feby from this Depart- 
ment to you, I find I have inadvertently said, that, " You can further 
show the facility, that will thus be afforded to the Manufactures of 
France, making way into the United States etc etc'' On reflection 
it occurs to me, that this would be placing you in an indelicate and 
improper position ; that altho the obvious results of very low duties 
in Texas, would be such as I have stated, yet, it would be wrong for 
you to call the attention of the French Government to it, as an induce- 
ment to forming any special commercial regulation with us. The 
sagacity of her Ministers would require no such promptings. Our 
last advices from our agent in Mexico leave our affairs in the same 
unsettled and doubtful state. The Cabinet of Mexico still have the 
exposition of Mr. Treat under consideration, and at the request of 
the Secretary of State, Mr Canedo, the project or basis of the pro- 
posed negotiation has been presented, and is still under consideration. 

It appears to me that the inference to be deduced from this want 
of decision and delay, on the part of the Mexican Government, is, 
that the present disturbed state of the provinces, renders it uncertain, 
what line of policy should be adopted; that they are unwilling to 
treat with us, and if in their power would make an effort to recover 
Texas; but this cannot be done until their internal difficulties have 
been settled. But should these difficulties increase, they would from 
necessity treat with us, hence it is their policy to gain time by every 
variety of artifice; and our passive position has encouraged them 
to this course. How long we shall continue in our present pacific 
policy, is, of course uncertain, but that we are loosing some decided 
advantages by it, there can be no doubt. Should the Constitution 
of 1824 be restored, or should the Republic of Mexico be dismem- 
bered, and a new political organization take place, which seems at 
present most probable, loe may have to contend with a more ener-

getic and efficient power under the new organization. Whereas, if 
we had offered them the least aid by co-operating against the defeated 
party, we could have our own terms of a treaty. The federalists 
have been for the moment put down on the Rio Grande, but they are 
not subdued, and are ready to rise ^gain at the first favorable Con- 
juncture. In Yucatan and Valadolid, their success has been com- 
plete; and the Newspapers, altho under strict servilance, in the State 
of Me2dco itself, came out openly in favor of the Constitution of 
182i. I have no doubt the present rulers will attempt a compromise 
by a declaration in favor of the Constitution; every thing however 
is imcertain. 

With great respect

Sir, Your Communication of the 27th March was not received 
until two days ago. I hope that long ere now, you have received the 
Authority forwarded to you from this Department, and that some- 
thing decisive has been done. 

The President has directed me to instruct you, that if after the 
reception of your credentials, you can obtain no decisively favorable 
answer to our overtures for peace, that you will withdraw from your 
Agency. Should this be the result, you are instructed to make known 
to the Minister of Her Britanic Majesty in Mexico, that should this 
Government be constrained to change its position and conmence 
offensive operations, it will not be with a view of extending our terri- 
tory, beyond the Rio Grande and any occupation or military move- 
ments west of that River, will be temporary and solely with the view 
of forcing the enemy to make peace. I ardently hope however, you 
will be able to effect the object of our mission. Be the event what 
it may, you may be assured that the President highly appreciates your 
services, and is fully sensible of the zeal and ability with which you 
have discharged the very delicate trust confided to you.

I have the honor to be,

(Confldentlml.) 

Mmaoo Mc^ 7th. ISIfl. 
Sib. 

I have the honor to hand you herewith Copy of my loBt short 
despatch^ under date of 80th Ulto. and have now the pleasure to 
apprise you of the result of the then pending deliberaticAs of the 
Mewican Cabinet^ which, so faty is all I could desire as a preliminary 
Step. 

• In my respects under date of 21st. Ulto., I infwmed you [of] the 
course which the Secretary then proposed to pursue, and altho' there 
was some unexpected delay in getting the Subject before the Cabinet 
Yet on Tuesday Evening^ 6th. inst, the Session was held, and the 
result was that the whole of the papers, documents, and correspond- 
ence, were ordered to be submitted to the " Council of Government " 
for their opinion; and also the Question: If the Council Concur 
with the Cabinet in their resolution to ask Congress for Special 
powers to negotiate an amicable arrangement with the Govmt of 
Texas. 

The papers would be sent to Council today, but there is no Session 
of that body until Tuesday next 12th. inst, and this delay is very 
convenient^ as it give us a little time for reflection. 

If the Council concur with the Govemmt, or Cabinet, as regards 
opening formally the negotiation, they will also concur in Sending 
to Congress The Iniciative in question, asking for powers to negotiate. 
If Congress grant the powers asked for by Government, they will 
probably not be discretionary^ but limited: Say, 1st. They may pass 
the resolution, giving the necessary authority, under certain fixed 
basesy or Conditions^ and thus bind the hands of Government, or Sd. 
They may grant the necessary authority, provided all the leading 
provisions of the arrangement shall be submitted to Congress, for 
their final approbation, before Governmt. can close the negotiation. 
This last named plan suits me besty as it gives me a chance to remove 
obstacles^ and pave the way. 

The Govmt, with these powers in hand, will Soon Know officially 
how far I can go, and what I must have in return ; in fact^ they know 
already the Cardinal points of the proposals your Govemmt has 
been long since prepared to make. When the Government have 
obtained my best Terms^ or sine qua non conditions^ they will lay the 
propositions before Congress, cmd^ should the Govermnent and Cof^ 
gress be satisfied that they cannot do any better with me, we may 
come to an arrangement, within the tenor of your instructions. 
This, however, Seems almost too much even to hope for^ under all

the circmnstanoes of the Case, and I dare not express this Expecta- 
tion ; Yet I will say : that, if the matter get% before Congress^ I shall 
tJien have reasonable hopes of Some Success. Nor do I think a small 
difference (after the business has gone So fa^) will destroy the 
negotiation. 

This " Council " of which I speak is a constitutional branch of the 
Government, and a part of the Executive^ as the latter and his 
Cabinet cannot even initiate a law or introduce a project in Congress 
without first obtaining the Concurrence of this said Council. Hence 
the necessity of taking this step before the Govmt. could appeal to 
Congress; and Jience^ also the same necessity for the authority of 
Congress, before they can proceed further with me. 

This council is composed of thirteen Members, but Nine constitute 
a quorum^ and is the Number who usually attend to the despatch of 
all business. J. D. Ala/man is the President, and Oorostioza^ one of 
the influential members. 

The President wUl appoint a Committee to report on the Subject, 
when the discussion will take place, and the Secretary's of State, 
Canedo, and of War^ AhnorUe^ will be present to Explain the views of 
the Cabinet, and their own. 

I am willing to hazard the remark (in this instance) that the 
chances^ in my opinion^ are Equal that their action will be in favour 
of our Views. Thus I have endeavoured to give as clear an Idea as I 
could of the present position of my affairs here; and will n^t conceal 
the fact that I feel somewhat more satisfied with appearances. 

Nevertheless^ I would not be sanguine^ even of tiie issue in Council, 
and less of the final result ; as all my experience shews that here it is 
extremely difficult to cmticipate events of this magnitude and char- 
acter, and with such elements around me, with any degree of cer- 
tainty. 

I will just add that the Secretary of State^ in relating to me the 
result of the Cabinet Conference^ on yesterday morning observed em- 
phatically: ^'my dear Sir^ we have now travelled two thirds of our 
Journey." I deduct half, and call it one-third, of my distance ; our 
Success in the Council, the other third; and the authorization of 
Ccmgress, the remmrdng third. 

With this remark, and the facts before you, I leave you, Sir, to 
draw your own inferences. 

I have written General Hamilton this day^ announcing in sub- 
stance this first Step in my negotiation. 

I send my letter to New York, under cover to your consul there, 
with directions, if the Gen. has embarked, to forward it immediately 
to London. 

No arrivals from N. Orleans yet; nor have I received the original of 
the plenary powers, duplicate of which I have already Acknowledged.

[Confldftntlal] 

Muxioo May 28tJu 1840. 
Sir. 

I have the honor to enclose you copy of my last respects of 7th. 
inst. to which I beg leave to refer you, in case it should reach you, 
before the original. I am now just able to get out from indisposition 
which has confined me to my room for upwards of ^ fortnight but am 
now convalescing, I hope permanently, tho' gradually. This con- 
finement, at so important a moment, has been unfortunate, and the 
more so as I have found much more difficulty to Encounter in this 
Council^ as I anticipated, and hence the delay of their decision to the 
present time. 

Mr. Gorostiza, a friend of Gl. Santa Anna's, and opposed, in 
general politics, to the Gvmt., who, from the beginning, I anticipated 
would make some opposition, but did not think he would carry a 
majority with him, went formally against the project. A committee 
of three of said Council reported unanimously favourably to the 
Views of the Cabinet, but, to the surprize of the Secretary of State 
and the Minority, Gorostiza and his four friends, voted down the 
report, 5. to 4. 

By a rule of Council, in such cases the subject is handed over to a 
new committee composed of the Majority, and Gorostiza was, in this 
instance, appointed chairman of the new Committee, and we might, 
of course, anticipate a Report from him counter to our views. I 
found it indispensably necessary to influence the Gentleman and in-: 
duce him so to modify his report, as to Send the whole matter to 
Congress, altho' in doing this, he would so Shape it as to be con- 
sistent with his and his colleagues previous votes and speaches, on

the former occasion. I think that my Efforts, and those of some 
friends will prove Successful, as I am assured that whatever may be 
the rcange and tenor of the report, it will be Such as will Square with 
the Kesolution that will be proposed, viz: To transmit the whole^ 
Subject, without expressing an opinion themselves, to the consider- 
ation of Congress. With this, and some other timely measures, I 
think I can expect the result promised. 

Gorostiza and the Secretary of State are personally and politically 
unfriendly, and Mr. C[aned]o desired a triumph in Council over the 
Secretary, whose Views and wishes, however, differed but little, in 
Fact, from the arguments of Mr. Gorostiza and his party. The differ- 
ence is That, if the question had been carried according to Mr. 
Canedo's first plan, the Subject would have gone to Congress with an 
Iniciative of the Gvmt. and Council ; while, in the other case, it will 
be presented without an opinion from Either Cabinet or Council. 

The matter will Soon come to an issue, and I shall consider it very 
fortunate for US if we obtain a favourable result; in which case I 
shall, of Course, be detained for the final issue in Congress. But, 
Should I be disappointed in the Expected decision of the Council, 
or Should the Resolution of Congress be unfavourable to any negoti- 
ation with Texas, I shall receive, at once, my passports, and move, 
as rapidly as possible to N. Orleans, where I shall hope to receive 
your instructions, as regards proceeding forthwith to Texas for any 
verbal information you may desire to receive from me, as my report, 
for the present, may be found essentially in my correspondence, which 
has been full, and much in detail. Meanwhile, I shall continue to 
advise you of my further progress, and the final result, by every 
oppty. which are now very unfrequent. 

I should not conceal the very great apprehension I feel with regard 
to the permanence of the present Cabinet. I should not have been 
Surprised any day within the last fortnight at their Resignation, or, 
what would be quite as bad for me, that the Secretary of State 
should resign at any moment, altho' he has often himself assured me 
that he did not contemplate Such a Step. Events, however, may 
compel or induce him to this, which I should regret Exceedingly^ I 
assure You. The Govmt, are surrounded with difficulties, as I have 
already apprized you in former despatches, and they are accumulat- 
ing every day. 

Waiving the matter of Texas, which, no doubt, gives them Some 
uneasiness, pending the Question of Peace or War, (or, if you please,

into the neighboring State of Tobasco, and may be followed by the 
Department of Chiapas, [ — all this] embarrasses the Qvmt. very 
much. Other Small parties, in different parts of the Country, con- 
tinues in arms, with more or less success, and the federalists and op- 
position press, are crying aloud for a change of Ministry, The 
promised Reforms in the Central Constitution and against the project 
of Gvmt. now before Congress restricting the liberty of the Press; 
and among other things, the opposition have made a violent attack 
<m Mr. Pakenham, charging him with co-operating with, and even 
directing the measures of Gvmt., with having Sent a vessel of War 
to Yucatan with despatches and money for the Govmt. and generally 
interfering with the domestic concerns of the country, in favour of 
the present order of things, and in opposition to the Views of the 
opposition here, who wishes to destroy Centralism and reform the 
Constitution of 1824. 

But this is not all : there is a complete State of Anarchy or con- 
fusion, or at least. Entire want of Harmony between the various de- 
partments of Gvmt., the Executive^ Executive-Council^ Supreme 
Courts and Conservative-Power.^ Hardly any two of these agree 
on measures of moment, and a very angry and Serious altercation 
has recently occured between the first named and the latter power, 
which has now, As they both persist in their pretentions, almost 
Entirely absorbed public attention. The Govmt. has foimd it neces- 
sary to fortify itself on the Question, and counts for the issue upon 
the Deputies, and probably the Senate and its Council; and the 
Conservative-Power, composed of five individuals, who are irre- 
sponsible. Except to their own consciences and their Maker, will 
have the Supreme Court to sustain them in their struggle. Hence 
arises the fact that a Law of Congress is carried into Effect by 
Gvmt., and is in operation for two Months; the ConservativePower 
then declare it Null and Void^ and the Govmt. refuses to obey this 
decree, on the ground that it was not Enacted according to the pro- 
visions of the Constitution. Both insist, and Govmt. sends the 
Question to Congress for decision. Meantime Congress are deciding 
this Matter,* not yet taken up, Gvmt directs its military comman- 
dants in the Departments to obey the Law of Congress, and exercise 
military Jurisdiction in Some cases, and the Supreme Court directs 
the Judges of the same Departments to claim and hold civil Jurisdic- 
tion in the Same cases, under a pre-Existing Law, inasmuch as the 
Conservative-Power had declared Null and Void the law under 
which the Gvmt. claim military Jurisdiction.

This dark picture, Sir, will give you Some Idea of the sad and

not consider it an infraction of my duty so to do. It is my duty to 
report on both Sides of the question, whether favourable to my ob-

perusal of this letter, and all my preceding dispatches, whether in 
your opinion it was possible, under Existing circumstances, for me

Mexicx) June 3d. 1840. 

Evening. 
Sir. 

I have the honor to refer you to my last communication of 28th. 
Ulto, and regret that I cannot now enclose you a Copy, as I have but 
a moment's time to avail of this idghPs post for Tampico, whence I 
hope this will find a prompt conveyance to N. Orleans, and thence to 
your hands. * 

By my last (if it precedes this) you will perceive that their Coun- 
cil have occupied much more time in their deliberations on the Grand 
question than I had anticipated in my respects of 7th. Ulto ; and that 
numerous caurses of delay, and an opposition not foreseen^ had 
placed in jeopardy the final result in that body, where a rejection of 
the wh/>le matter would have been to close the door against any fur- 
ther action, on my part. 

I had been confined to my bed, for upwards of a fortnight, and 
have now been out and convalescing ordy a few days, which was the 
more unfortunate, as this matter was by no means to be left to its faiCj 
nor to the care of others^ but required much vigilance and attention. 

Today ^ the " Council " have another meeting, and I think will de- 
cide the matter; and I hope it will be in our favour^ and that I shall 
be consigned over to Congress for the fate of my mission, which is 
the ordy (and of course^ the best) result that could occur, unless they 
rejected the whole question. 

This hasty letter is therefore written, whUe I am awaiting the re- 
sult^ to add the same in a postscript. 

The schooner Wetter arrived at Tampico on the 26th. Ultto from 
N. Orleans, and I trust has despatches from the Department for me, 
which I shall await for with impatience, until the 8th. inst.y on which 
day tl^e post will arrive with her correspondence, and I trust I shall 
v^t be disappointed.

By a sort of compromise of opinions, it was agreed unanimously 
(at last) to Submit the Whole Texas question to Congress, to resolve 
the first and main question; viz — Peace or War. If they decide in 
favour of War^ or what is the same thing, measures to recover that 
Territory, of course my mission is at an end. 

If they resolve on peace^ or what is perhaps equivalent, and may ' 
lead to it, negotiation^ then they will of course, authorize the GrovTn't, 
to open negotiations with me, or receive my propositions, in some 
form, perhaps^ under Some restrictions, or may he^ at the discretion 
of Govmt. This naked or general question will -first be proposed and 
decided, without submitting any hases or Conditions. If Peace or a 
hearing of your Agent be resolved upon, then the Govmt. will enter 
into the details that may be necessary and proceed to receive my 
propositions. 

It will probably require a week, to lay the Matter before the Depu- 
ties^ and how long for action^ on the m^in question^ I cannot say. 
All I can now add is that this result, I consider prima facia evidence 
of a disposition towards an amicable arrangement of some Sort on 
the part of Govmt. and Council. 

They were in my opinion in favour of peace^ but they did not like 
to assume the responsibility of any action other than what I have 
stated, but threw the responsibility on the Sovereignty of the people. 

I must 7U)w enlighten these Representatives all / can, and leave the 
rest to the united wisdom of both Houses of Congress.

certain documents addressed to Mr Pakenham, and also a communi- 
cation from him to you in relation to the claim of certain of Her 
Majesty's subjects for a part of the cargo of the Little Penn, and for 
the Capture and detention of the Eliza Kussell. By this conveyance 
I have written to Mr Pakenham,® but I fear not as satisfactorily as 
I could have wished in consequence of my being absent from the 
seat of Government. 

I beg you to give Mr Pakenham an assurance that the subjects 
embraced in your despatch shall receive my earliest attention on my 
return to the Seat of Government. 

In your last on the subject of your Agency, you say that you are 
not in possession of the views of this Government as to what you 
should do in the event of the Mexican Government expressing a 
willingness to agree to a Truce, and not to a treaty of peace. I am 
sorry that there has been some mistake in the Department on this 
subject, as I had distinctly understood from my predecessor that you 
had been apprized, that a truce would suit the views of this Govern- 
ment as well as a treaty of peace: and perhaps on some accounts it 
ought to be preferred. A truce for one, two or three years, with a 
stipulation of six months notice of a recommencement of hostilities 
would enable us at the termination of that period to dictate almost 
any terms to our enemy, from the great augmentation of strength 
we should undoubtedly receive. If we make a treaty of peace now, 
we of course must submit to some sacrifices, as your instructions 
show. You are however Authorized to conclude a treaty of peace, 
or a truce for the greatest length of time it can be obtained. 

Comodore Moore, with three or four of our Vessels of War, goes 
down into the Gulf and this will be sent into Vera Cruz, by some 
friendly flag he may fall in with. His instructions are to act on the 
defensive entirely ; to make no captures unless you should advise him 
of the failure of your Mission. He will be able to make a calcula- 
tion as to the time when this despatch will reach Vera Cruz, and one 
of his vessels will stand off and on from Point Mariandria, thirty 
five or forty miles North and West of Vera Cruz, for thirteen days 
after the despatches have been delivered at Vera Cruz ; and should . 
you have any communications to make to the Comodore through 
such channel, you will advise the Vessel bearing it to hoist a white 
flag afore on coming in sight of any vessel off the point designated, 
which will be answered. 

Some time ago, the date not recollected, as my letter book is at the 
seat of Government, I wrote to you, that it was the wish of the 
President, that after the reception of your Credentials, you would 
bring the negotiation to a close in some way, that we could no longer

submit to the state of things, then existing on our frontier. The 
QoTemment of Mexico then and now, neglected no opportunity to 
annoy us, by all the means it possessed. True, we were not invaded 
so far as to make an attack by the regular Army of the Grovemment 
on our inhabitants, but small predatory bands were continually sent 
to excite the Indians to attack us; and the Indian Chiefs were re- 
ceived at Matamoras, and sent out for the same purpose, whilst we 
made no movements at all hostile to the Mexican Govt., We even for- 
bid and used the best influence of the Government to prevent Volun- 
teers from Texas joining the Federal party; and that our efforts 
were in a great measure successful, is evinced by the very small number 
of Texians who crossed the Rio Grande, when the federalists were 
defeated; they were informed that personal protection was all that 
could be extended to the fugitives, that we could not recognize them 
as belonging to any CJovemment, nor would any flag but our own be 
permitted within our territory; we have given them no more coun- 
tenance, nor protection than would have been afforded to fugitives 
under such Circumstances by a government on the most friendly foot- 
ing with Mexico. All of this time whilst we were exhibiting such 
proofs of our moderation, the Mexican Govermt has neglected no 
opportunity, to excite Indian hostilities against us. The exercise of 
so much forbearance on the part of the President, it was hoped would 
have been met by a reciprocity of feeling by the Mexican Govt ; but 
in this we have been sadly disappointed; and at this time we have 
the most conclusive evidence of emissaries having been sent from 
Matamoras to the Indian tribes on our frontiers,* and to many of 
those within the limits of the United States, to excite them by the 
hope of general plunder to attack us; whilst Gteneral Arista is unre- 
mitting in fulminating his threats of invasion and universal exter- 
mination of our people. These threats it is true we disregard, and 
know well how very important they are; and at the same time we 
know perfectly, it is in our power to drive back the boaster, and 
carry the war into his own Country ; for in truth nothing would have 
been easier than to have sustained the Federalists, and enabled them 
to have bid defiance to the Central Government. Our Navy for the 
last twelve months strong enough to have cut off every article of 
Mexican Commerce and blockaded her ports, has kept idle and in- 
active ; we had made a declaration that we would pursue this course 
of moderation, and evince to the world that we indulged no ambi- 
tious designs of conquest. To this policy we have steadfastly 
adhered. Our forbearance is nearly exhausted, the patience of the 
people will not much longer submit to a procrastination, from whidi 
they can perceive no adequate advantage, and the administration 
will be forced to return War for War. I am directed by the Presi-

what effect the appearance of our squadron will have on the negotia- 
tion in which you have been engaged; will it be likely to produce 
additional difficulties or to facilitate a favorable issue? What are 
the prospects of effecting a permanent pacification, flattering or other- 
wise? if not can a truce be obtained to continue for one, two or three 
years? If you think the prospect good; how long is it probable it 
would be before it could be brought about? If you should feel much 
confidence that a little further forbearance on our part would insure 
a peace or a truce, we will act on your suggestion. It would per- 
haps, be well for you to urge upon Mexico the moderation of this 
Government in not co-operating (thus far) with the Federalists on 
the Rio Grande as she has been strongly urged to do, and might have 
done with great benefit to herself and detriment to Mexico, that it 
is a forbearance we cannot practice much longer, lest we loose all 
the advantages which such a co-operation would give us, without 
gaining any thing from the Central Government of Mexico. The 
Federalists are still sanguine of Success, and unremitting in their 
overtures to us, to make a Common Cause in making war on the 
Centralists, and in return, would grant every thing we could reason- 
ably ask of them. Should you believe as before expressed, that a 
little longer delay and forbearance on our part will be productive of 
success, it is the wish of the President that you should continue your 
efforts, and advise this Government fully as to the prospects of suc- 
cess. Should you fail and believe, that no further advantage can 
result from your longer protracting the negotiation, the President 
requests that you will inform Commodore Moore of such failure, 
and of the termination of your Agency. 

I would suggest that it will perhaps be well to confer freely with 
Mr. Pakenham on the prospect of bringing your agency to successful 
issue, and read to him such parts of this letter, as you may think it 
not improper he should hear. I send this under an evelope to him. 

Commodore Moore is instructed not to approach near enough to 
create any alarm. He is also instructed to obtain the best informa- 
tion in his power as to the condition of Yucatan, and the views of its 
Chiefs, whether friendly or otherwise to us. 
I am with great respect 
Your obdt Servant

Mexio June HtJu 18Ifi. 
Sir 

I have the honor to wait on you herewith, with Copies of my last 
three very hasty despatches, dated of 28th. May, 3d. and 6th. inst., 
to which, if needful, I beg reference ; duplicate of my preceding com- 
munication of 7th. ulto. being alrerdy on its way. 

You will perceive by my advices above refered to how matters 
stood up to the 6th. inst. since when, three or four Consecutive holy- 
days and their necessary consequences have prevented any further 
progress, unless it be that the papers to be referred to Congress, in 
relation to Texas, have been preparing, and if not sent in yesterday^ 
which I doubt, may be today ^ or tomorrow^ when I shall watch their 
progress with great anxiety, and an interest, which I will not attempt 
to describe. 

Meanwhile, and since the action of Congress, the Matter has gained 
publicity, as you will perceive by the Slips I enclose you from the 
opposition papers. The CosTnopolitic is the most respectable and 
called the organ of the federal party. The Equilibrium is a more 
Violent paper, and also against the Government, Neither of them is 
verj' scrupulous, as regards the trmth of their statements, as they 
write to abuse the Gvmt. and make converts to their party. You 
will therefore credit neither, where their statements conflict with my 
Despatches. I send them, as they shew what I have before Stated, 
that the opposition will oppose the question of Acknowledgement, 
independently of its merits, and merely to Embarass more and more 
the Government. 

Campeche has finally Surrendered to the Revolutionary party, 
and Some movements have taken place in the adjoining Department 
of Tabasco, where it is doubtful if the Central forces are sufficient 
to with Stand the Example and Efforts of Yucatan, now entirely 
free. 

At present the Gvmt. are doing nothing towards preparing an 
Expedition against the revolted Department^ and it is doubtful if 
they will, as it would require Some Vessels of war and three thousand 
men, at least, to Subjugate that Peninsula. They have not means 
for this, and have too many Cares nearer home. 

The Question between the Gvmt. and Conservative Power remains 
open, Congress not having acted on the question, and Should they 
decide favourable to the Gvmt., as is prohahle^ the Conservative

CORRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 647 

Power would, as is believed^ declare Nvll and Void said law, and 
these powers would remain in the Same hostile attitude as before. 

The fact is they are surrounded with difficulties, and if the present 
Ministry maintain themselves in power, and can Sustain the present 
order of things, it must be by going ahead^ with a strong hand^ 
regardless of the clamours of the people, or the denunciations of the 
press. They must cut the gordian knot^ and carry through their 
plans and measures, if need be, at the point of the bayonet. This 
Conservative power Stands in their way, as it now has the power of 
anulling all Laws, by a plausible argument (very Easy among these 
people) of Unconstitutionality. 

As regards the opposition press, the Gvmt. will soon have it in 
their power to check it, under the Law restricting the liberty of the 
press, which has, or will unquestionably^ pass the chamber of Dep- 
uties, and, doubtless^ the Senate also. Should the Conservative power 
declare it Nxdl^ the Executive will probably disobey the Mandate, and 
execute' the Law. 

Then there will soon come up the proposed Reforms in the Consti- 
tution^ now in Committee of Deputies, who will propose to abolish 
this Conservative Power, or -restrict its powers, and it will be fol- 
lowed by a declaration of Nullity, so that there Seems to be no 
pacific termination of the Matter, even prospectively. A compromise 
was attempted, but it is now entirely given up. 

Almontes iniciative of December last, asking for Means to restore 
Texas to the National Umon^ has just become a Law, having been 
under consideration Six Months^ been rejected Several times^ and 
imdergone So many modifications that it amounts to Nothing^ so far 
as Texas is concernd. 

The Law establishes a Contribution in the Departments, the pro- 
ceeds of which the Gvmt. are authorized to appropriate to several 
distinct objects, and the balance towards the Restoration of Texas. 

The project Submitted to Congress declaring all Persons traitors 
who espoused the cause of Texas is sleeping quietly with the Com- 
mittee, who will probably never report thereon. 

Congress has recently authorized Gvmt. to take up a Loan of 
One Million and they are now endeavouring to raise Some money 
under it. They offer 1% per mo., but this premium is merely nomi- 
nal: it will cost them 2 or 3% per mo., in the way they usually 
manage such Negotiations here. 

This state of things, however deplorable in itself^ is in many re- 
spects favourable to our object^ for the Stronger the Gvmt. and the 
more bold and vigorous {despotic if You please) its Measures, so much 
the better for our question ; provided always^ they can Sustain them- 
selves, and their plans; hold the Congress and Council in Subservi- 
ency, and keep the Army and the Hosts of Officers under pay, on their

Side. My apprehensions are that the Ministry will Either fail in 
nerve to go through with their Measures, or that, before they get 
through with their difficulties, they will Strain the cords so tight 
as to produce an Explosion^ and this will lead to a DictatOTy at least 
pro tem^ who will be Bustamante in one case^ or perchance^ Santa 
Anna, in the other, according as the balance of military power and 
influence may previal. 

P. S. Friday June 19tk I have delayed my despatches one post, 
which will still be in time for the Steamer Argyle, Should she, on 
her arrival from N. Orleans, determine to return thither, as I Jiope; 
if noty this must go via Havana. I have nothing specially new to 
add to my remarks of 14th. inst. Public affairs Continue to look 
Very dubious. There has been delay in the presentation of the 
question in relation to Texas to Congress. The Govmt. have been 
exceedingly occupied with their Complicated and increasing difficul- 
tly, and particularly the Secretary of State, who, is on the point of 
despatching the Conmiissioners, under the Convention with *the U. 
States.^ 

They will leave to-morrow, and if today my papers do not go in, I 
have no doubt they will next week, Unless delayed by the threatening 
aspect of affairs. Congress is too busy to take them up just now, even 
if they had them, for half their time is passed in Secret Session, 
moved by themselves, or called for by the Government. Yesterday, 
the whole Cabinet, four Ministers, went to the Chambers, and asked 
for an immediate Session with closed doors. Object not yet pronrnt- 
gated. Rumours of resignation of the Ministry, have been very gen- 
eral, for Several days, and every body talks of a " Coup d' Estat " 
from sbme quarter. What the issue will be, it would be more than 
useless to Conjecture.^ 

Under these circumstances, it will not be considered a matter of any 
surprize, that I make no immediate progress in the Chambers, or that 
the Government should desire a moment of greater calm than the 
present, to present this matter before Congress. 

So I must await events, which I hope may favour us, and yoit. Sir, 
must exercise all your patience, for the final result. 
I am. Sir, with the highest respect 
and consideration, 

Your most obedient Servant.

Treat to Lipsoomb.* 

Mf^xico June 19th. J840. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the reception, on the 3d. instant, 
of your valued conmnmication of 1st. April, enclosing me authority 
to dr&w on the Loan Commissioners in London for a sum equivalent 
to Two Thouand Dollars; and, by the same conveyance, I received 
the Duplicate thereof^ the former, through the kindness of R. Paken- 
ham Esquire, and the latter, from Mr. M. Burrough, of Vera Cru^ : 
All of which' have been duly noted. 

I also received, at the same time, the original of a despatch) from 
the Hon. David G. Burnet, then acting Secretary of State, dated 
12th. March, enclosing my plenary powers, a letter for R. Pakenham 
Esquire, and a proclamation by H. E. the President of the Republic; 
the duplicate of which, with the above named papers, with the 
exception of the proclamation * I had already received on the 15th. 
of April, and recommenced acting under said power, having imme- 
diately delivered the Communication to Mr. Pakenham, who was 
pleased with its Contents, and has since replied to the same. 

The Proclamation of the President, I handed forthwith to the Sec- 
retary of State, Senor Don Juan de Dios Cafiedo, who placed it on 
file with my previous Commimications, where it will serve to Shew 
the sincerity and consistency of Texas, in its present negotiations 
with Mexico. 

Altho' this communication from your Department has already been 
acknowledged to H. E. the President, and Perhaps Sufficiently re- 
plied to, it may not be improper for me to offer a few brief remarks, 
in reference to its Contents. 

I have taken due Note of all that relates, to the objects of my 
mission, and shall continue to confine my negotiations to the essefvtial 



•A. L. 8. » See note •, p. 641.

points of Becognition, (which necessarily involves Peace) Boundaries 
fixed and defined, if attainable^ and Stipulations of indemnity^ to- 
gether with such further Conditions as necessarily grow out of the 
above provisions, leaving all minor points that can be omitted in this 
preliminary Treaty to be entered upon and adjusted hereafter, as 
may be agreed upon. 

As regards any Stipulation to pay a part or the whole of the 
indemnity in Mexican Bonds^ I understand that the Grovemment of 
Texas is indifferent as it contemplates no direct advantage, if this 
course Should be adopted. It was originally Suggested merely to 
meet the anticipated wishes of this Government, and to facilitate 
Day negotiation, and not because any benefit would accrue to Texas; 
but further reflection induces me to believe that, if the Mexican Gov- 
ernment prefer this course, and it Should be thought favourable to 
the adjusUnent of the question of indemnity, / should assent to it^ 
(but in strict accordance with my instructions) inasmuch as it 
might he of some advantage to the Commissioners in London, in 
facilitating the Loan of indemnity. 

Nothing, however, has passed between the Secretary of State and 
myself on this point, as we have not yet reached any offlciail details, 
as regards the propositions of Texas to Mexico, the only paper which 
I have submitted embracing proposals having been transmitted to 
the President, and, as you will have seen, [it] is very general. 

If the period should fottunately arrive when this question comes 
up, I shall endeavour to make it Subserve the interests of Texas^ or if 
not, omit it entirely. 

As regards the painful paragraph of Judge Burnet's letter, relat- 
ing to the Sad fate of Lt. Col. Johnson and his companions, I took 
early opportunity to read the Statement to the Secretary of State, 
and, I think^ with due effect. 

In answer to ymir communication, I have to thank the President 
and yourself, for attending to my request, in relation to funds, but 
regret they will not be available here^ as it will be impracticable to 
negotiate my drafts; perhaps, however, on reaching New Orleans, I 
can effect my object there^ and thus replace any sum I may take up 
here on my ovm credit. 

The approbation of the President of my official course here is 
highly gratifying, and whatever may be the result of my Mission, 
my humble, tho' unceasing efforts shall not be suspended n(Mr dimin- 
ished for a single moment, until I reach some issue. 

I beg leave respectfully to refer the Department I have the honor 
to address, to my despatches hereiaith addressed to Gen Lamar, to 
whom I have heretofore transmitted all communications, having 
reference to my Mission. As 1 have received no intimation to adopt

a different course, I shall continue to do so, altho' I am aware it may 
be considered Somewhat irregular. 

I forward this to Vera Cruz, hoping the Steamer Argyle, which 
left there on the 6th inst for N. Orleans, will have returned by the 
25th. and [will] depart again for the Same destination. If not^ 
they must go via Havana^ as opportunities direct for any American 
Port in the Gulf are very unfrequent. 

Please present my best respects to Judge Burnet and Mr. Starr, 
both whom, with yourself, I hope are enjoying good health. 

I have the honor to be. Sir, with great respect and consideration,

despatch from Mr. Treat ijiformiBg you that he had failed in his 
negotiations, you will in that event be authorized to cruise against the 
Mexican vessels, and make prizes of them, taking care to avoid all 
collision with neutral powers; always respecting the principle, that 
a Neutral Flag protects the cargo. 

You will be particular to avoid all offensive means, and not shew 
yourself before Vera-Cruz or any other Mexican Port, until after you 
have heard from Mr. Treat. Should you not hear from Mexico, 
after waiting the term before mentioned, you will wait at some safe 
and convenient place, and send to this Government, for further in- 
structions. You will not conmience hostilities unless you should be 
informed by Mr. Treat, of the failure of his negotiations. If you 
should be attacked, you will of course be at liberty to defend yourself 
and the honor of your Flag, by destroying, or capturing the enemy's 
vessel, whether public or merchantman. It is the object of this Gov- 
ernment to avoid all hostilities with the Mexican Govt until Mr. 
Treat can be heard from, and until you receive orders from this 
Government, unless you should be informed by Mr. Treat that his 
negotiation had failed, and you are expected to use every precaution 
to avoid defeating the views of this Government. 

You will endeavour to ascertain the condition of the State of 
Yucatan, and the dispositicm of those functionaries administering 
their Government, whether friendly or otherwise to us, any manifesta-

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of May 21st. dated in Washington, signed by Mr. N. 
Amory came safe to hand, and I am happy to find that you have not 
entirely forgotten me : though it is the first line I have received from 
any one concerned in the Republic of Texas since my arrival here.

tened together, and the copied mattep mns continuoosly so as to form a alogle manu- 
script. Neither letter is signed nor is either addressed to any one by name. The manu- 
script, however, in its general make up, in the handwriting of the copyist, in the sise of 
the sheets, and in the manner of binding them together resembles closely that containtng 
a similar series transmitted by Bee on April 30, and described as from his secret agent in 
Mexico, who was K, S. Wright This l^ct, together with the matter of the letters them- 
selves, seems to make it reasonably certain that the communications were from Wright. 
As to their being written to Bee there is no question.

Mr. Bryan has never written me, or if he has, I have never I'eceived 
his favors; and if he has nevet* written I am at a loss to account for 
the cause. 

I am informed by your favor above mentioned, that you have 
received several of my letters, and that you had been pleased to note 
their contents with interest. This is at least some encouragement to 
me, however imimportant my feeble efforts may have been : my busi- 
ness and particular care has ever been not to deviate from the truth, 
nor suffer myself to become excited from mere report unless I was 
otherwise convinced by further demonstrative proof. Nothing can 
be gathered in this Country in the Streets. No one has the same 
story as his neighbour, neither do the people in general have a 
Knowledge of what is to take place, or, in another word what the 
private councils of Government are doing, or what are their views; 
perhaps there never was a more contrary body of men at the head of 
a Republic, than those now composing the two houses of Mexico. 

I have been nearly a year in this Country, and I can assure you, 
Dear Sir, that during said time I have not been idle, in obtaining 
every essential information possible, and have forwarded the same 
from time to tinyt as opportunity offered : but, am sorry to say, that 
I am still a Novice, and have yet much to learn in order to Keep 
pace with the affairs of Mexico, so as to be able to obtain anything 
correct. You therefore must excuse my error, wherein I may be 
deceived and give incorrect information. The affairs of this coimtry 
are ever changing, and there is no Knowing what a single day may 
bring forth; for example, when the troops of Arista some months 
since left here for Rio Grande, no one was aware of the Move, except 
the few, until the troops were beheld marching out of the City. I 
wrote you accordingly of said expedition, and of the daily augmenta- 
tion of the Army, and that the Government had a double view in 
said expedition. 1st. That of quelling the Federals, and if strong 
enough march into Texas. A part of Said Army still remains in 
the Rio Grande Country, but the want of money and the loss of 
Yucatan has put a stop to the expedition for the present, but Gt)v- 
ernment's intention is still bent on the destruction of that people 
(the Texans). It is however hardly probable that they will be able 
under present difficulties to raise an army sufficient for even a trial 
during the present year, and very possibly never. But we must not 
however be too certain so as to lay aside the means of defence, in 
case they should succeed in their intentions; so let not the army be 
diminished but rather augmented, for reasons which you will here- 
after learn, previous to the conclusion of this letter. 

In reference to the political state of affairs in Mexico, it stands 
much in the same way, as when t last wrote, with the exception of a

few changes for the worse ; and if I am not much mistaken bears great 
affinity to that in which it stood in the time in which Tturbide was 
raised to the Imperial throne, with this exception, that at that time 
a General was raised to the rank of an Emperor, and now Busta- 
mente would only be a Dictator : this Country twenty years ago was 
if I am not misinformed in a state of revolution much in like manner 
as we find it at present. 

I have beheld with sorrow for the last six months the great efforts 
made by the President and his Privy Council to raise themselves to 
greater power ; each Step they take diews this fact in more and more 
glowing colours, which is now evident. The whole and sole aim of 
Govermt. at present is to trample on the Constitution, break down the 
barriers placed in opposition by the Conservative Power, check the 
progress of the freedom of the press, blast the fluttering dying flame 
of republican spirit that exists and sink the country beneath a des- 
potic law. 

To be able to compete with their enemies, the Centrals find that 
this is necessary ; nothing short of this will answer their views ; with- 
out this measure their hopes of continuance is diminished and their 
future glory ruined ; without this, they are persuaded with the oppo- 
sition of many of the Ministry, They never will be able to call to 
their aid neither Men nor Money sufficient to subdue their enemies. 

Poor Mexico, the fairest flower of the Northern World is however 
to be ruined. Nothing it seems to me can save her. Filled with 
every national good, her mountains composed of enormous Mineral 
wealth, her Avenues strewed with gold, her vales with the most deli- 
cious fruits and grains, must all be lost, sink, perish, for want of a 
perental republican intelligent guide. Her mineral wealth it is true 
will still exist : but to us, to all of the present generation, lost. 

I am persuaded. Dear Sir, that Mexico peopled by an industrious 
intelligent community, acquainted with the arts, and under good and 
wholesome laws might be made to produce millions instead of the 
now lingering draging diminished thousands; for who can tell 
the wealth of the minerals of this more than Mineral World. 

Were I permitted to let my poor and ignorant mind, take its flight 
and dive into futurity, I would have presented to my fond imagina- 
tion Mexico flourishing in all that pride which Nature has rendered 
her capable of enjoying. But to what future period do you refer? 
might be asked. How many generations must pass first? Who 
shall be the happy people that shall live to see Mexico raised to so 
flourishing a state? This, kind Sir, is bound to be brought about in 
time, however unfavourable it may appear at present, and fifty years 
will not have passed when this shall have taken place ; I do not wish 
to be laughed at, when I thus take the liberty to speak of what I 
think to be the future prospect of Mexico and the pride of Texas !

CORRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 655 

Yes Sir, Texas is bound to take possession of this Country, there 
is nothing to prevent her, and she will be the happy Nation that 
shall restore Mexico to more than her former wealth and prosperity. 
Mexico will no doubt from what is now going on, impede the pros- 
perity of Texas by every means in her power, perhaps invade her 
territory, give battle, lay waste some of her fairest settlements on 
her frontiers, endeavour to blockade her ports, call the wild indians 
to her aid, and gather the United States Indians on the Rio Grande^ 
to assist them, I mean the Creeks^ Cherokees^ Delawares^ Shavmees^ 
and the Spartan blooded Seminoles, The 1st. have 13,000, 2d. 10,000, 
3d. 650, 4th and 5th. 750 Warriors, mark what I say; but all this 
will amount to nothing in the end, but their final destruction as a 
people, and in twenty years may be seen the lonely Single Starred 
Flag proudly waiving over the palace of the Vice-Kings of Mexico. 

Texas as a nation is fast increasing in strength, her laws are 
wholesome to the settler, strangers behold it and flock to her bosom, 
many citizens of Mexico see the same, and often in private express 
a wish that the laws of Texas extended as far as here. • 

I can assure Col. Bee, that hundreds within the last Six months 
have changed in favour of Texas, and I am sorry to say, that the 
Government is so decidedly against taking any measures in order 
to recognize that republic. 

But to proceed more closely with the movements of this Govern- 
ment, I must inform you of the Step that has been taken by the 
Conservative power which was formed when the Constitution was 
framed, to see that no violations should be made relative to the Con- 
stitution either by the President or his Cabinet. This Conservative 
power, not from any good that they would contribute either to the 
Country or the people, have seen fit to declare null and void all such 
laws as they consider unconstitutional in order that they may 
acquire, no doubt, some sinister or interested motive in view, for 
their own aggrandizement, no telling what. 

A law was lately passed by both Houses and signed by the Presi- 
dent declaring that all thieves should be judged by a military tri- 
bunal, and if foimd guilty, to be put to death without further cere- 
mony. This the Conservative power annuled as unconstitutional; 
but [it] was not annulled by that power until the time expressed 
in the Constitution had expired which is two months. They have 
pronounced it void on the day after the expiration of said "^ time, 
declaring, from some frivolous proofs that the 1st. day of the 3d. 
month was not denied them to declare their sentiments, stating in 
corroboration as evidence that Congress had often acted on the 1st. 
of January when term of session had expired on the last day of 
December. This has caused much contention, hard thoughts, and 
even dpwn to shameful threatenings.

656 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

However right the Conservative power may have been, however 
pure their motives, every good man for the sake of divesting this 
comitry of the ten thousand thieves it has, would be glad that the 
law should remain good and in full force. 

Now the President says, if you will not allow me funds, nor means 
to carry on a war against the enemies of the Country, how is the 
Government to stand? If you annul* my laws and those of both 
Houses, how shall I be able to satisfy the various demands of the 
country ; no good can arise from such conduct on your part. There- 
fore my only plan is to pursue my own Course, choose my own 
Ministers, form my own Council, strengthen the reins of my Gov- 
ernment by increasing the number of my friends, and augmenting 
the army, and then declaring myself Dictator, send you all to the 
DevU. 

And this tho' it may appear improbable is not impossible. Bus- 
tamente has lately received an additional help, which is not to be 
considered in a trifling light, and is that an Arch-Bishop has lately 
been ordained with great pomp in the Cathedral of this City. His 
Excellency was the padre Godfather to His Holyness, having pre- 
sented him previously with a beautiful ring valued at fifteen hun- 
dred dollars. I mean that His Excellency tht President was the 
bestower of this valuable ornament to this honorable prelate. 

The Arch-Bishop according to custom with religious bodies, when 
suflFered to be connected with affairs of State will use his utmost 
influence to support the present views of Government; as he is 
aware that a change would be much to the injury of the Church 
property, as well as to the progress of the Church in general. You 
are no doubt aware that the rigidness of the Roman Church is equal 
if it does not exceed even Rome itself. Yet we are much better off 
in the City of Mexico, than we would be in Pueblo, a city sixty miles 
east of this: that City is still envelopped in all the dark shades 
extant in the time of the establishment of the inquesition: but few 
strangers are willing to live among them, and it is not long since it 
was not uncommon to hear of the Stage being heartily pelted with 
Stones, Eggs, Rotten fruit, etc. by the boys of the town, when filled 
with strangers. It is a beautiful city highly situated near two vol- 
canic mountains, overlooking it, in romantic, majestic grandeur, the 
tops covered with eternal snow. This city swarms with a large 
population, counts its Sixty thousand inhabitants, and will you 
believe me when I tell you, not a single newspaper is permitted to 
be printed among them. It is a City composed of Priests, Monks, 
and Nuns, and Superstitious, ignorant, saucy impertinent people. 
And this may be applied to them in general — ^with very few excep- 
tions. Now I would remark that when a people is so deeply buried 
in superstition, what may not a Bishop, or an Arch-Bishop do among

them? particularly when the most of them believe that he has the 
power of either sending them to heaven or to hell. 

Upon this is built the grounds on which rests the hopes of Bus- 
tamente's Ministry. Religion I have already said is going down in 
this country, but notwithstanding this, I do not see that the people 
are becoming more wise — I mean the lower class. 

I must leave oflf for to-night. The Chambers will open on the tst. 
and from them I may be able to draw something of more weighty 
consideration.

July Ist. llSJfi.l 
Dear Sir, 

I was this morning in the palnce at the opening of the Chambers — 
when the President was ushered into the House, with the usual mili- 
tary pojnp, that of having the way lined with Soldiers from his Rooms 
to the House of Congress. 

His views and that of his privy Council had been drawn up, upon 
some two sheets of common sized letter paper, rather short but 
pointed, and of the most urgent nature, 1st. that of bettering the Con- 
stitution for the salvation of the Republic ; and the good of the people ; 
the reconquering of Yucatan and Tobasco; that of the necessity of 
punishing thieves — the great necessity of procuring a fleet, and that of 
an IMMEDIATE EXPEDITION AGAINST Texas. Do not be alarmed ; tho' 
I am sorry to inform you that they have procured loans (Cash already 
at hand) to the amount of Eight hundred thousand dollars, expressly 
for said expedition, and not a dollar to be taken from said amount, 
save that of Texas.** But do not be alarmed so long as you have 
notice of their movements, which you may always be certain to have 
in due time when there is any possible chance; but, for Heaven's sake, 
do not leave me to wait another year without hearing from you, or I 
will turn Turk or forsake the cause, which would be hard on my side 
after spending my time and fortune for better than two years. I can 
hang on and breathe perhaps a year or two longer without any assist- 
ance, but I must not be slighted with neglect: however, even that shall 
have no effect upon my mind, as to my faithful discharge of duty ; as 
I shall I hope to be able to have soul enough to spurn anjrthing like 
neglect towards ^ a people for whom I have risked so much. In this 
I have been already tried. This Govt, having learned that an Ameri- 
can was in this City who was well acquainted with the Indian fron- 
tiers, sent for me, through General Filosola, proposing a rich reward if 
I would contribute to^the information of their Government relative to

those tribes on the frontiers, and i>y beeoming a pioneer or pilot in 
those regions. To this, I politely returned an answer, that it was not 
in my power to satisfy their wish, as only having been a Trader in 
that Country a Short time, and that my informati(»i was veiy limited, 
respecting the number and feelings of the savage tribes ; ^ and further 
[as] an American Citizen, I could not comply with their request. I 
have never been furth^ iq)o]£en to on the Subject, but have since heard 
that a (would be) friend of mine in this city, who was in the United 
States when some of my letters appeared in the Arkansas papers, 
relative to the frontiers had hinted this to some of the leading men of 
this Government, in order he says to serve me, thinking that I would 
have no objection, As my information could do no harm against the 
United States and from said motive [he] considered the movement 
in a very favorable light, to assist a friend; but tho' I cannot in con- 
science give you his name, as he has ever been very cautious in making 
remarks that might have injured me, yet I must go so far as to inform 
you that I have lately heard he is one of the disappointed Eleven 
league men, having claims against Texas for large tracts of land. 
Some future day I may give you his name, but as I am confident 
you do not know him, it matters not if you should ever know him. 

I would not have related tihis to you, only to shew you in confi- 
dence, what a traitor might do in this country; and be well assured 
that nothing on my part shall be neglected so long as Z have health 
and means in making every communication to you or the Government 
which may be of an interesting nature or useful tendency. One thing 
I would have you bear in mind, and that is to overlook my badly 
formed sentences: though educated at St. Mary's College near Balti- 
more, curse me if I can recollect the orthography of my language, 
owing to the many years of my residence in Spain, during which 
time I paid very little attention to the English language, and this 
has even injured me in composition. I mention this in order that 
you may account for so many errors which J have no doubt you find 
in my letters. 

Again, relative to what was read in the House this morning, and 
my conversation with a Colonel of the Army, I must inform you tiiat 
^n expedition is ripe for Texas, and that you must believe me, for 
it is no excited supposition from the spur of the moment Por the 
sake of the little Bepublic, believe me Sir, until I inform you to the 
contrary. It will not I think be made very soon. The troops on 
Bio Grande are nearly all now at Metamoras. Between three and 
four thousand men under General Arista. Canaliso is on his way 
to this City by superior order owing I understand bo his having com-

mitted some fault in not having co-operated with Arista when the last 
battle was fought with Canales, It appears that Canaliso, being the 
oldest man did not wish to be oommanded by a younger General of 
equal rank. I think I hinted some thing of the kind either to you 
or Mr. Bryan and I have not been mistaken. 

The troops now under Arista, being composed of his former 
[force], and now that of Canaliso, will remain on the Rio Grande 
until every thing is ripe for crossing the river: so that you may rest 
contented for the present, and perhaps for three of four months, as 
they have concluded not to be too hasty in the affair, and have ordered 
a halt in what was considered to be the present troops designed to go 
against Texas. I have often said that this Country is very slow in 
its movements ; So are all Spanish Governments, and it may be prob- 
able that this third effort to reconquer Texas may not be ready for 
this twelve months to come. But there is no Knowing, and I would 
rather you should believe the danger nigh, than to view it too far off. 
That it is the determination of Mexico to make a grand effort, and 
that they have $800,000 to commence with, is I believe without a 
single doubt; and you have my request that you take measures accord- 
ingly. I can say no more for the present on this subject and shall 
now give you some account of the Indian frontiers whidi I am per- 
suaded you nor the Grovemment cannot have, which is of the highest 
importance to Texas, and I have obtained it throu^ a series of diffi- 
culties, and under the most peculiar circumstances, but in order not 
to tire out your life by reading my never ending communications, I 
i^all proceed at once to give you the Most important in as few words 
as possible. As follows: At the time of the battle of Arista with 
Canales, there were present several Indians from the Arkansas terri- 
tory who had just arrived, and were resting from the long voyage 
they had had over the plains of New Mexico; among these were 
several Indian chiefs or Captains on business of importance, which 
was to obtain permission from the Government of Mexico to settle 
on their vacant lands, in order to become citizens, and be r^noved as 
far from the Americans as possible, having they said, understood 
that Mexico was willing and anxious to receive them. This I Knew 
in 1839. All but one of these Indians returned after the battle, and 
after conversing with Arista, Except one a Cherokee and he having 
authority from the Chiefe of his Nation and others was dispatched 
by Arista under the protection of a Lieutenant Colonel (Teniente 
Colonel) to this City of Mexico strongly recommended by the said 
Arista to head quarters as a personage of the highest consideration. 
Said Indian arrived. I procured his confidence, found him quite 
intelligent Can read and write— is nearly white— has been at Wash-

ington, and is no doubt a man of ccMisideration among his people. 
He was immediately despatched ; ^ obtained permission to remain in 
the Rio Grande Country with all the tribes who under friendly views 
wished to accompany him. He asked for California, having under- 
stood it to be the best country, this however was denied him : the Rio 
Grande Country however is at the service of all the United States 
Indians from Chichuachua ^ down as low as Tamaulipas, including 
the former and latter States, north of those of Coanala y Nuevo Leon, 
This is to be accomplished as soon as circumstances will admit. They 
are to move as soon as they see proper. Here is what you saw hinted 
at on a preceding page, and carries with it matters of the highest 
consideration to Texas.« I will not comment upon it; you see the 
views of the Government, you have only to be wise. I have informed 
you of it and I hope you will take measures accordingly. 

While in the Minister's room today with this Indian and the 
Colonel that attends on his business, in conversation upon the present 
proposed campaign against Texas (he having the utmost confidence 
in me) I remarked (to find out his mind) " You would no doubt be 
glad if this Chief with his neighboring tribes were now on the Rio 
Grande, they could no doubt be serviceable to you." "Would to 
God — would to God they were, they would be of great help to us." 
I add the above to show you the views of Government, more strongly, 
in regard to this matter. The Indian informs me, that they cannot 
get out under Eighteen Months, or two years, with their families, 
but that the young Men will no doubt come immediately, he says, 
further, that they do not wish to take any part with Mexico, in their 
quarrels, but however sincere he may be, he nor no other man of his 
tribe can prevent them ; ^ and I find some three or four of the same 
party, belonging to the Chief's company, actually took part with 
Arista against Canalis and fought for Arista, merely to show them- 
selves. 

I will now go on to mention something further on this subject, 
when I will proceed to give an account of the Indian frontiers. 

[Here follows a translation of Almonte to Brown, June 20, 1840.*]

CORRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 661 

July 2d. 
Dear Sir, 

Owing to my leaving the city in the morning for the interior for 
a few days, am under the necessity of closing this letter rather 
abruptly. As it was my intention to give a full statement of the 
Indian frontiers down as late as January, I shall now only speak of 
the most interesting particulars. 1st. Near the old Spanish fort« 
were in January, some five or six thousand Camanches, Men, Women, 
and Children, then moving on slowly towards San Antonio; they 
said, they were in pursuit of Buffaloes, and did not intend to molest 
the Texans; but appeared to be hostile toward that people, but I 
learn further from my informant that they (the Camanches) ap- 
peared to be afraid of the Texans. 

The Cayeways^ were high up on the North or Main fork of 
Braosos, not far from where I left them, when out. They were not 
supposed at this time, (December) to have much notion of sallying 
down on Texas, as they said they were going to do, when I saw them. 
The Pawnee tribes very hostile, but fearful. Some five hundred 
Camanches are on the little Witchytaco,*' a streajn heading nearly at 
Braosos, and empties in the Red River some twenty miles above the 
Friendly (but thieving) Maives; this was in November, and is all 
at present I shall be able to say on this subject. 

The news of Col. ^ being in the Mines of Guadalahara is 

«, as I have made every enquiry ; there may be some American 

prisoner there who would pass himself off for Col. Crockett. Is it 
not the duty of the United States to enquire into the affair? but 
no, I forget — ^it is not the custom for them to bother themselves 
about American prisoners in strange lands, it is the English and 
French Governments who condescend to do that. 

Some few weeks since an unhappy affair took place at California, 
some fifty Americans were taken prisoners and delivered over to the 
Devil or some one else by the Mexican authorities, stating that said 
Americans were found engaged in a plot of revolution ; poor fellows, 
God only knows what will be their end! and as I have said, the 
United States will not see to it. And furthermore the United States 
have never had a Minister nor a Consul in this Country, that was con- 
sidered any better than a Jack- Ass and respected and feared about 

•At San Saba. 

• Klowas. 

• Wichita. 

'The name originally written here, but erased, was doubtless Crockett. There was a 
story that obtained some currency In Texas, through a letter written from Camargo, Febru- 
ary 6, 1840, by William C. White to the editor of the AuBtin City Gazette, and published 
in the Issue of that paper for March 18, 1840, to the effect that Crockett had not been 
killed at the Alamo, but that he had been captured, and was Imprisoned in the mines of 
Guadalajara, where White, not long before the letter was written, had seen him.

as much, with the exception of Poinsett. My opinion is so good, and 
so well confirmed in what I have said, that I would sooner in any 
serious matter throw myself by three hundred pr. cent on the English

The Delegates appointed for Washington will leave by first Vessel; 
much trouble has it cost this Government to get them ready.*

Don Joachim Velasqu^ de Lion is the oUmt, and you will no 
doubt see their honors at your public halls ; no great scratch I can as- 
sure you, have travelled some, know how to bow, be very polite, 
smoke cigars and perhaps waltz round a ball room with tolerable 
grace. 

I must inform you before I leave off, of my calling on Mr. Treat, 
but not until very lately: poor feUow, I was sorry to find him so 
ill. This climate is not good for him; it is too high and the air 
is too much rarefied, and owing to the want of oxygen [he] is ever 
liable to take cold. I found him polite and friendly and am mudi 
pleased with him, and sorry that I had not called on him sooner. 
The letter you were pleased to send me, first fell into his hands, owing 
to the absence of Mr. *; you wiU however please direct your 

next letters in the same way as my * will know whom to send 

them to. 

Take no rapid measures, from what I have told you of Mexico. 
For Mexico will move so slow that you may always keep ahead of her.

Mexico July 4th. 1840. 
Sir. 

I beg leave to wait on you with a Copy of my last respects, under 
the various dates of 14th. 19th. and 20th. Ulto, to which I refer you, 
should this first reaqh you as I was compelled to send the original, 
with various duplicates, by way of Havana, no other opportunity 
offering in any direction. I have the honor to hand you aiso here- 
with Copy of a Communication addressed to the Secretary of State 
[of Mexico], under date 20th. Ulto, with Copies of the Extracts 
therein referred to, which were taken from a despatch from Col. Bee, 
dated Washington, April 28th. and received by me on the 19th. Ulto. 
The Secretary has since informed me verbally that he had ordered 
them translated^ and appended to the Documents in RelaUon fa Texas, 
for presentation to Congress, tim being precisely the main object I 
had in View, in making this communicati(». 

I hope you will approve of the course. I have adopted in relation 
to Col. Bee's communication, altho' I had long before Spoken to the 
Secretary, as regards both the points referred to. I have advised 
Col. B. what I have done in the matter here, for his information and 
Government. 

In the Post Script to my last, I anticipated that the days of the 
present Ministry were nearly numbered^ and that they would be Com- 
pelled to succumb^ ov that the result of the Existing struggle might 
produce Anarchy, if not a thorough Revolution. 

Such, indeed, was the aspect of things at that time, but I am now 
happy to inform you that during the last fortnight, things have 
changed for the better, and at present, the political horrizon appears 
tranquil and favourable to the party in power. 

I hope it may thus continue, at least, until I Can get through with 
my business, for the ordinary delays are enough to try the patience 
of a Joh, and when these extraordinary causes for postponement 
arise altho' irresistible, yet they together produce a loss of time, which 
is really frightful, to one who calculates time, as we are so apt to do. 

No further progress has yet been made, or in other words our 
matter is not yet before the Congress, for the Various reasons to 
which I have before adverted. 

The Secy of State however assured me yesterday that within a 
week it should go forward — ih'sX the subject had lost none of its 
interest with him or the (Jovmt. and in fact, I thought, seemed to 
feel an increased interest in the matter, in all which I take it for 
granted the Secretary is Sincere.

I shall however Verry soon be able to test this point, for I know 
of no good reason now why the matter should be further postponed, 
altho\ I entirely coucmt in the policy of the delay tkus far. 

The oppK)sition press continue to harp upon me and ihy mission, 
and charge the Administration with an intention to recognize Texas, 
and now and then attack ilr. Pakenham for his interference in t?ieir 
domestic concerns. 

But as they attempt 7U> argument^ their object not being in any 
sense patriotic but purely personal and levelled ordy against the 
ministry^ of course the effect produced is but momentary. 

The Govmt. Press denies the charges^ and says that the question 
of Texas is not under the advisement of the Cabinet, and some 
curious articles occasionally appear, in strange quarters^ all which is 
more or less unaccountable to me. The ordinary period of the Ses- 
sion of Congress closed 30th. June, and that body was re-opened by 
the President on the 1st. inst In the Presidents Speech, he speaks 
of " The Usurpation of Texas " as one among the various im- 
portant matters which will claim the attention of Congress — ^but he 
goes no further. The Speaker of the House in his reply to the Presi- 
dent outstrips him altogether, for he Says, in his excessive zeal, " Let 
us not rest, nor cease to labour for a single moment, in the Reduction 
" of Texas, tha4; Texas which is the head quarters of the Anarchists^ 
" and the nursery of Revolutions " etc etc ; with other similar and 
ridiculous Ideas. I had intended Sending you all these various Slips, 
rather for your amusement than anything else, but I finally gave it 
up, as a matter merely calculated to excite your laughter. 

I consider all these things as amounting to nothing, as against me, 
or my objects, and Still they appear so incomprehensible, incon- 
sistent, and impolitic, one cannot help expressing astonishment, at 
what appears to be such absolute foUy. I hope Sir, in my Next, to 
inform You of the first impressions of the Chamber of Deputies on 
this Question. 

In the meantime, I have the honor to be with the highest Considera-

I have thought it my duty to lay these Extracts before Y. E. 
for the information of H. E. the President of Mexico, who, with 
Y. E, will doubtless deplore the sad and cruel fate of Col Johnson, 
and his men, who had been Sent on a Service, alike advantageous to 
the Interests of Mexico, as it was honourable to the Sentiments of 
Philanthropy and Moderation, which actuated the President of 
Texas. 

H. E. the President of Mexico will also discover by those commimi-

during the administration of Gen. Lamar, and especidUy since he has 
more overtures for a friendly adjustment of differences, to the Gov-

Sib: 

I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your communica- 
tion of 7th. of May, both original and Duplicate having reached me 
on the 6th. instant, and I have carefully examined its contents. 

The communications which I have already had the hcmor to address 
to the President of Texas, and my despatch of thi^ days ^fefe, will 
shew to the Department I have the honor to address the exact posi- 
tion which I now occupy, in reference to the executicm of the Presi- 
dents instructions, with the Govmt of Mexico. 

They will also shew that the efforts made by Grovemment to pro- 
cure from Congress the necessary authority to open formal negotia^ 
tions with me evince, on their part, (so far as I can judge) a decidedly 
favourable disposition as regards some amicable arrangement with 
Texas, and they have adopted what was deemed the hest means to 
carry out their views. 

The course adopted, however, has been attended with great delay 
{yet almost inevitable) arising from the Very Singular organization 
of the Govmt. ; the peculiar State of Politic's and of parties; and the 
extreme delicacy and difficulty involved in the question at issue. 

The Govmt. therefore, being compelled to reach Congress Before it 
could act formally in the premises, and having now Succeeded in that 
object, it remains to be seen whether the influences which can be 
brought to bear on that body shall prove sufficient to induce it 1st 
To authorize Govmt. to treat with me and receive my propositions, 
and 2d. to approve and ratify the bases of these propositions, and 
direct Govmt to close a Treaty under said bases^ and such other gen- 
eral and Secondary provisions as it may deem expedient. 

In this position of my affairs, I have deemed it most politic and 
Expedient not to make known my conditional instructions to with- 
draw^ nor to act under them at the present moment^ until I see what 
the Report of the Committee^ may be on the general question of Texas ;

the consequent action of the Deputies; and (in the event of these 
being fa/oourable) how the Govmt. [will] receive my propositions, 
when fully and legally authorized by the Chambers to open a confer- 
ence and negotiations on the subject of my mission to Mexico. 

I hope^ and venture to belie ve^ that the latter period will arrive (if 
no unfortunate event should occur to suspend or vary my anticipated 
action of Govmt. and Congress, as regards the policy which I think 
they have marked out) and, therefore^ I have thought I could keep 
your last communication in reserve advantageously to meet any 
sticking point that may arise on the part of the Govmt, on the " sine 
qua non " or cardinal points and conditions, which I shall be com- 
pelled, in virtue of my instructions, to present to them for their 
consideration and decision. 

So long, then, as matters shall continue to go on Well and favour- 
ably, / shaU consider that the position of things is so far " decidedly 
favourable " " to our overtures for Peace " that your instructions to 
" withdraw from your agency " are not to be acted upon. 

But whenever anything indicates a change in the course of things; 
an unjustifiable delay; or I shallcome to any Stopping pointy where 
both parties seem determined not to give way; in flne^ whenever I 
can make use of your instructions to advantage, either to, accelerate 
action, or remove obstacles, I shall then act upon them^ and such 
other incidental arguments as may be judiciously drawn from them 
and circumstances^ to produce the desired effect. 

In adopting this plan of procedure, I conceive that I have, for the 
present^ best fulfilled the Spirit and even letter of your instructions, 
and am pursuing a course corresponding with the wishes of the 
President and the interests of Texas, as exhibited in your last com- 
munication, as well as in the general tenor of my original instructions. 

Having come to the foregoing conclusion, I thought proper to 
consult Mr. Pakenham, whose first impression was to make use of the 
contents of your letter at once^ but, after discussion and reflection, he 
finally co-incided with me, to hold it in reserve for a future day. 

I hope, therefore, in view of the reasons herein contained, and 
those embraced in my Various despatches, the Department and the 
President will approve the course I have thus t^niporarily adopted. 

I again refer the Department to my letters to the President, here- 
with^ for all further particulars. 

I have the honor to be, with great Respect and Consideration, 
Your Most obedient Servant, 

James Treat

]Mexico July 13th. 1840. . 

SlH. 

I last had the honor to address you under date of ith. inst., enclosing 
a copy of a communication directed to the Mexican Secretary of State 
duplicates of which I have the pleasure to hand you herewith, as it 
is very possible this may be the first received, as my letters now go 
to the Coast, without [my] knowing of any special conveyance tor 
them, and are sent forward as opty., direct or indirect, may chance to 
offer ; hence they must reach you very irregularly. 

Since my last, Every thing has continued apparently quiet ; but pub- 
blic affairs are far from being firmly settled : nor are the main difficul- 
ties of the Govmt. yet surmounted. Both Houses of Congress have 
Sanctioned a decree favourable to the Govmt. in its pending conflict 
with the Conservative power^ and it now remains to be seen whether 
the latter will declare it null or not. The Govmt. have a majority in 
both Chambers and in the CowncU in their favour, and, thus far, a 
Majority of the Commandants General and Governors of the Prov- 
inces also; while the Conservative Power have the Supr^ne Court 
and another Corporation called the Court Martial on their Side. 
The Army [is] mainly for the Govmt. The Government seemed de- 
termined to carry their points, and in the Reforms of the Constitu- 
tion already reported by a' Committee of the House and soon to be 
discussed, it will endeavour to destroy the Consenjative power, or, 
at least, restrict its invmense prorogatives, and nullify its Sover- 
eignty over both, the Govmt. and Congress. If in the meantime the 
Conservative Body and its corporate Supporters before named should 
push matters to Extremes by further acts of nullity (nullification), 
or by a dissolution of their respective Bodies, a State of Anarchy will 
ensue which may destroy the legitimacy of the Govmt. and terminate 
in a revolutionary Struggle, which will be decided by the Military 
force instead of public opinion, and the probable result of aU will be 
the Elevation of a Dictator, if not for life, at least temporarily. 

I only hope that these Events are yet so far of that I may get fairly 
through before they commence, and that the Govmt. will Sustain 
itself and keep its different branches together until I can obtain 
Some Result through the Action of Congress, which will be decisive, 
for the present at least, of Your Overtures for Peace. 

This, Sir, is the very uncertain and unsatisfactory State of things, 
as apparent at the present Moment. 

The Deputies having Sanctioned the project of Govmt. restricting 
the liberty of the Press, it is now in Senate, where it will undoubtedly

be approved. The Govmt. contemplate no movement against Yuca- 
tan, for the present. They have no Vessels of war, nor means. If 
they can retain their authority over the neighboring State of Tobasco, 
they will do well, and even this is yet very doubtful. The Depart, of 
War and Marine have called on Congress for authority and means to 
obtain a Navy. The project of Gvmt. says it shall consist of nothing 
larger than Corvettes^ and not more than 3 of these^ i Brigs^ 6 
Schooners^ 3, Steamers and H Gun Boats — armed launches. The 
total cost is estimated at PI2 million of Dollars^ and the annual Ex- 
pense at ONE million of Dollars. This will be passed by Congress, 
but the Ways and Means will be hard to find just now. 

Gen. Canaliso has been recalled from the command of Matamoras, 
and is now on his way to the Capital. Gen. Arista has taken the 
entire command of the whole of the Northern Division of the Army, 
and all the frontier Departments. It is said he has under his orders 
4000 troops. New Mexico, it is believed, has declared for Federation, 
or Independence, it is said here by Some, through the aid and co-oper- 
ation of the Texians. The topic of the intended Recognition of Texas 
by Gvmt. is still adverted to by the papers, and insisted on by Some, 
while others have heretofore denied any such plan, or intentions. Of 
Canales we know nothing positive ; he is said to be reorganizing and 
concentrating his forces. The Million Loan is now being taken up, 
at the rate of about 80% Gas\ and W% papers^ which cost the 
parties about 5. to 8% of its face. Interest 1. to 1.^2% pr Month. 

So much for affairs purely Mexican^ but which effect indirectly the 
interests of Texas. You will now like to hear something of our own 
affairs, in relation to which I have but little to say. On the 3d. July 
a call was made in the House of Representatives on the Executive, for 
any and all information and Documents in his possession, in relation 
to Texas, and on the 6th. inst. the Gvmt. Sent in all the papers, docu- 
ments and correspondence in its possession, with the report and 
A ction thereon of the Gvmt. and Council. The papers were endorsed 
^'Urgent ^^ to be acted on " with closed doors^'^ and the Speaker of the 
House, in introducing the Subject, Said that " the Subjelt was of the 
highest importance^ and he particularly requested the most rigid 
Secrecy on the part of the Members." The papers were read and 
passed to a preexisting Special Committee on Texan affairs of three 
Persons. Yesterday, one of the opposition papers announced the fact 
that the Subject was before the Chambers, on a motion made by Such 
[and such] a Member^ and that Gvmt. had recommended great 
Secrecy in its discussion. The Committee will not probably report 
sooner, than 10. or 8. days hence. I trust that they will report in 
accordance with the wishes of the Gvmt. and my own, and I hope 
the House will sustain the report, and that I shall therefore be called 
upon, in due form, to open my Negotiation with th^ Secretary of

instructions and the discreticm which I must necessarily ex€»rcise to 
Some Extent^ I can make my propositions so far acceiptable, or admis- 
sible, on the part of Gvmt. as to induce it to exercise all its influence 
in the Chambers in the Batification of the bases of the arrangement^ 
I think I will then have Succeeded in obtaining a Treaty of Peaoe^ 
Recognition^ Indemnity and Uamts. If we cannot agree in all the 
cardinal points, we may in some of them, and I shall, at least, be able 
to ascertain how far they are willing now to go to meet your Views, 
and some good may therefore grow out of my Mission. 

Any conjectures beyond the above^ would appear superfluous. T 
have ventured to anticipate thus mMch, for your information, and I 
trust satisfaction, and that of your Cabinet. I muet however again 
beg leave, respectfully to remind you, that nothing can be more uncer- 
tain, than political calculations on Such a delicate topic, in Such a

My last respects were under date of 13th. instant, copy of whidi 
you have enclosed, and to it I beg leave to refer You, as it contains 
the hopes and Expectations I then entertained, in relation to my 
pending negotiation. 

I also crave reference to my despatch of same date to the Hon. the 
Secretary of State, in reply to his last communication. 

Since then, the scene has changed, and the Event I have so long 
and so much apprehended has occurred : viz. a Revolution, so far as 
the Capital is concerned. The movement is on the part of the Feder- 
alists against the Existing Central Government, and as yet the ques- 
tion of Supremacy remains undecided, altho' this is the ninth day 
since the Commencement of the Struggle. 

During the night of the 14th. and morning of the 15th. inst the 
Federal party and forces made a quiet movement, and Seized upon.

and took possession of the Palace, and secured the President, Busta- 
mente, and his Smte^ without firing a gun. 

Making the Palace their Head Quarters^ all those who were dis- 
posed to join them flocked thither, while the Grovmt. troops were 
organizing at the Arsenal. 

Mr Farias,* the leader of the party, was called to the direction of 
affairs at the Palace as President ^ with Mr. Eejon as his Minister of 
the Interior^ the command of the revoluticmary forces being confided 
to Gerd. Urrea. 

On the Govmt. Side, the Troops were commanded by Mnjor Gen. 
Valencia, and the only Minister that appeared was Almonte, Secy of 
War, as the organ of Govemmt. 

The Govmt. intimated to the revolters a Surrender in two hoyrsy 
or an attack would be made on the Palace; and up to 2 P. M. both 
parties were marching troops, posting their Cannon, and Securing 
Such of the Churches, convents, and advantageous positions, as were 
within the jurisdiction of their respective cannon. 

A negative to the Summons was given ; the Hour Expired ; and the 
Govmt. troops conmienced an attack at 2 P. M. on the 15th. The 
firing was very active for an hour or two, both of cannon and 
Musketry, and the loss of Life on both Sides probably nearly equal, 
tho' very Smalls as it was pretty much at long Shot as usual 

The firing continued, tho' languidly and at intervals from both 
Sides, during the day and night, and next morning, the 16th. whew^ 
a cessation took place, and a parley was brought about by President 
Bustamente who had been liberated from the Palace that Morning, 
as is saidy for the purpose of bringing about an arrangement of differ- 
ences. Commissioners from both sides met, but could agree on noth- 
ing, but to terminate the question by Arms. 

At midnight the firing re-commenced, thus shewing tiiat negotia- 
tions were at an end, for the present. 

This is, in Substance, what has occurred during the first 48 hours, 
of the outbreak^ and frcMn that period to the present, the Storj;^ is a 
brief one. 

Bustamente and all his Ministers, and probably his Council, have 
assembled in the Convent of St Augustin, which is the Head Quarters 
of the Govmt. 

They have declared the City in a State of Siege, and imder 
Martial Law. They have received, and are receiving, reinforce- 
ments or Troops from the surrounding cities and Towns, are extend- 
ing their lines, as oppty. will permit, increasing their battering 
cannon, and during the whole of this period of Six days, have kept 
up an occasional, firing up on the Palace, day and night, which has 
been as constantly returned. The Palace, also, has received some 

f Gomez Farfas, a liberal leader, who had been acting President of Mexico, 1838-34.

re-inforcements, and their respective forces are not far from equal, 
nearly all those of the Palace being infmitry; while a majority of the 
Govmt forces are cavalry. The City was deprived of its usual supply 
of water for about 48 Hours, by order of the Govmt. which is now 
restored. One or two Sortie's from the Palace, and three or four 
active attacks from the Govmt. troops, have been the occasion of some 
severe firing, for an hour or two^ generally in the night, and with 
these exceptions, the firing on both Sides has been casual and des- 
ultory; just enough to prevent either party frcwn advancing or 
Securing any new positions. 

The Govmt. at the commencement dislodged them from one or two 
important outposts^ but latterly they have gained no decided ad- 
vantages, nor advanced their Posts. So that things remain essentially 
about the same as at the offset. 

Meantime no movement (so far as we know) has taken place in 
favour of the federalists, but the Departments, so far as heard from, 
and according to the Govmt. Bulletin's, respond in favour of 
Government. 

Gen. St. Anna^ (ever ready to put down the federalists, with whom 
he has lost caste) has arrived at Perote, with, it is said^ about 1000 
Troops, whence he will probably move and a/)t according to 
Circumstances. 

He tells the Govmt. that he is ready to co-operate in the restoration 
of order, and maintainance of the existing State of things. It is in- 
deed reported that he will arrive here, or in the neighborhood, today 
or tomorrow, but this is uncertain. It is very probable he will come^ 
but Jiow soon^ is doubtful. 

What I have said of recent events is from the best grounded re- 
ports and rumours, and a rational deduction from aU that is Said 
pro and con. 

'Facts^ we cannot ascertain, as we are all shut up, and unable to 
Visit any one without the risk of a random Shot or Shell, which are 
almost constantly flying over and around us. 

I fear, my dear Sir, I have already exhausted your patience with 
my necessarily dull and long report^ of nine days Revolution and 
fighting, without coming to any conclusion. 

As regards the final result, and its bearing on my affairs, I will 
venture to remark that, if the Governmt succeed in putting down the 
Revolution without the intervention of St. Anna^ public affairs will 
re-assume their former position, more^ or lesSj and my negotiation 
will be resumed, and carried forward to an issue, perhaps more 
rapidly^ in consequence of late events. //, a^ain^ the Govmt. are 
compelled, or induced, to call in, or accept, the aid of St. Anna and 
his troops, he will co-operate to put down the Revolution, hut all 
the rest will be for Bimself,

Should he appear as Mediator^ at the call of his friends and parti- 
zanSj and not in accordance with the wishes of Government, the troops 
may declare him Dictator and the Conservative Power may confirm it. 

However the affair may terminate, or whoever may reach the ad- 
ministration of tlie Govmt, I shall, as soon as any degree of order 
is restored, press the object pf my Mission to the most Speedy termi- 
nation, possible^ and, in the event of my being unable to do this 
promptly and successfully^ I shall, pursuant to my contingent instruc- 
tions^ withdraw from my Mission. 

July 27th. This was intended to go, by the British Cabinet Cour- 
ier to have left on the 2J^th.^ but the Minister has detained the Mes- 
senger until tOTTiorrow Morning^ when he will departs for Vera Cruz. 

This delay enables me to annoimce the termination of the Revolu- 
tionary movement in the Capital. 

On the 24th. and 25th. the firing was kept up among the Belliger- 
ents, and at times verry briskly, but for the last two days there has 
been but very little, and since Yesterday nx>on^ not a single Shot has 
been fired. 

The Archbishop profferred his mediation to the federal party, and 
then went to Govmt. where, during the last night and this morning, 
a sort of agreement, capitulation, or at least, understanding^ was 
entered into between the parties, and this morning neither of the 
two chiefs were to be found in the Palace^ Gomez Farias^ nor Vrrea. 

The officers signed, or agreed to, the arrangement. The terms have 
not transpired^ but it is believed that Farias escaped from a hope- 
less enterprize, and that Urrea sold himself to Govmt., and then 
was permitted to escape also. St. Anna, at last accounts, had reached 
Puehla^ and was coming on, with all his forces, and whether he will 
still advance to the City after he hears that the federals have Suc- 
cumbed, remains to be seen. 

It is rumoured that, by the arrangement, B'ustamente will resign^ 
and if so, St. Anna may be called to his place, in which case^ the old 
Ministry falls^ and St. Anna's friends will occupy their places. 

In Such Event, and if Congress still occupy their Seats, as is 
probable, I have an idea that my business may be much abbreviated, 
and I may succeed entirely. 

Either this, or St Anna will at once decline any and all action on 
the question, and use the old War cry of an Expedition against Texas, 
to enable him to reorganize and increase the Army for his Ultimate 
Views and purposes. 

One of these courses, I think it most likely he will adopt, if he gets 
into power, (which is yet doubtful!) and, of the twOj I think the 
former the most probable. 

If Bustamante and his ministry resume, and St. Anna does not 
come in at all, things will probably move on as before, and my

Postscript. July 29th^ Momg. Since the foregoing, things have 
settled down pretty quietly, altho' Martial Law is still in force, and 
and will be until the 1st. proximo. This has led some to believe that 
this measure is int^ided to promote St Anna's views, should he come. 
He was supposed to be at Puebla last evening. The Govmt tell him 
oU is over, and his presence not required. His friends, no doubt , tell 
him how things are situated A^re, and, whether he will return home 
under his disappointment at not having a finger in the Pye, or push 
ahead, and compel Bustamante to resign, and he go in as President, 
or Dictator, remains to he seen. If he brings 1000 good men, he can 
do what he likes, with the aid and co-operation he will find here. I 
am however, inclined to believe that the future administration of 
affairs, will return to the former parties in power, and remain for a 
while, tho' many think the Ministers, if not Bustamante, wiU resign. 
We have no Proclamation from the President yet, announcing the

I beg leave, most respectfully, to refer the Department I have the 
honor to adress to my despatch to Gren : Lamar, of this date, which 
goes herewith, for the particulars of what has transpired since my 
last advices of July 23rd. to 27th. inclusive^ copies of which are now 
transmitted. 

In addition to which, I have only to remark that, as soon as the 
Govmt. had become a little settled, Say on or about the 1st. of 
August, I thought it opportune to advert to your contingent instruc- 
tions of 7th. May, in an interview I had with the Secretary of State, 
hoping it would produce accelerated action on his part, in relation 
to my Question. 

The Conversation that took place undoubtedly produced an im- 
pression on the mind of the Secretary, and especially when I in- 
formed him, that my late instructions would not permit me to re- 
main much longer without Some decisively favourable progress^ in 
the question of Texas, then fully before him. 

But the peculiar position of the Cabinet, and particularly of the 
Secretary himself has induced a suspension, for the time being, 
and until the question of Extraordinary Powers asked for by the 
Govmt. shall be decided, as will more fully, and at length appear, 
by my communication of today, to the President", to which I again 
respectfully refer the Department. Without anything further of

Sir 

I have the honor to hand you herewith Copies of my last despatch 
bearing dates from 23rd. to 27th. ult., inclusive, by which you will 
perceive that the Revolution, which broke out here on the 14th., and 
continued until the 27th. ulto., had put a stop, for the time being, to 
all ordinary public business, and of course, to mine. 

I had hoped, and it was generally believed, that the Govmt., hav- 
ing completely triumphed over the Federal party, would, after a few 
days, restore things to their accustomed tranquility, and proceed, in 
the affairs of Gvmt. with more Strength and popularity (at least 
nominally) than before.

But the reverse has been the fact, and their course (certainly a very 
difficult one under existing circumstances) has been marked with a 
timid and constantly vascillating policy, up to the present time. 
For some days after martial Law had expired, they apprehended 
another movement, on the part of some of the military of high rank, 
having for their object to bring in Sta. Anna, or, at least, to put 
out Bustamante and his Ministry; and it was 8 or 10 days before 
Santa Anna, by countermarching his troops, and retiring himself 
to his residence, relieved the Gvmt. from any immediate apprehen- 
sions, as regards his course of policy. 

Many, however, still think he makes a Virtue of Necessity^ and 
only waits a fit opportunity, which he has recently lost by misman- 
agement, to draw his sword, to Save the Republic; or be invited by 
circumstances, again to take the Helm of Stale, The Ministry then 
attempted a Resignation feeling their Situation rather weakened than 
otherwise by the Revolution, and public opinion seemed rather to 
mark out to them this course, as the terms of the capitulation with 
the Federal Revolution were neither popular, nor, as many thought, 
creditable to the Gvmt. 

Bustamante could not make up a new ministry to his mind, and 
of course opposed the resignation. Mr. Cuevas however, the Min- 
ister of the Interior, has resigned, and his place remains open, altho' 
it is reported, to have been offered to Several persons, who, it [is] 
stated would not agree to the conditions cermexed. 

The Cabinet, as a final measure, and one on which their continuance 
in office would depend, agreed to ask, in the mode pointed out by the 
Constitution, for Extraordinary powers; and the iniciative of the 
Law, has already passed the Chamber of Deputies, and sent to the 
Senate for concurrence, where, if concurred in, it goes to the Can- 
servative Pow'er^ for confirmation. 

Its fate in the Senate is somewhat doubtful, tho' it is generaUy 
thought it will pass in some form, perhaps with modifications. In the 
Conservative Body it is impossible to conjecture the result, depend- 
ing entirely upon intrigue and ulterior Views. This corporation is 
composed of five members only. 

If the Gvmt. do not obtain the Extraordinary Powers^ in Some 
Shape, or to Some Extent, the Ministry will then resign^ at least the 
Secretaries of State and Treasury, for it is believed that, in that 
Event, Bustamenta will retain Almonte as a Nucleus of the new 
Cabinet. 

Thus you see, my dear Sir, how easely a month may be lost, and one 
finds himself rather retarded in his progress, than otherwise. 

It has been painful to me in the extreme to witness these delays, 
and it is even more so, to be compelled to relate tiiem to you, as I 
know they will be anything but Satisfactory to yourself and your 
advisora

I have said this much, however, that you might the bnetter under- 
stand my exact present position. I have seen the Secretary repeatedly 
during this interval, and must do him the justice to Say, that, from all 
appearances, he has lost none of the interest, which he has uniformly 
felt, and expressed in our question. 

He declines, however, in the present agitated State of Affairs, to 
urge the Committee, who have charge of my papers, to make up their 
Report, and thus bring the matter at once before the Chambers for 
discussion, and especially while the question of the extry. powers 
asked for remains undecided. 

If tiie powers are granted, he has an accession of Strength, to carry 
the Texas question forward with more eclat, and if they are not 
granted, he quits office, and I must understand myself * with his Suc- 
cessor. I shall, in that case however, count upon all his influence in 
favour of our question. If I am compelled to re-open, or continue 
my negotiations with a new Secretary, I shall adopt a very brief plan^ 
in which I will endeavor to avoid any further procrastination of any 
moment, in bringing the matter to Scwne conclusion. 

I write without knowing of any opportunity to forward my letters 
unless via Havana. 

I send herewith a dupl. of my last to the Hon the Secretary of

eral Filasola and a number of other distinguished characters were 
in the power of the Federals. The Citadel * which is out of the City 
was not taken. At ten o'clock said day, the towers of the Cathedral, 
the Cuartel of Santo de Domingo, the Grovemment house, (Cabildo) 
with other houses around the Palace were fortified in order to defend 
themselves against an attack. In the palace was a great quantity 
of arms and ammunition ; they counted at 12 o'clock some two thou- 
sand men, of which six or seven hundred were organized soldiers, 
and the rest made up of volunteers from the street Such an oppor- 
tunity of conquering, the Federalists will never have again; they 
also found upwards of Three hundred thousand dollars in money. 
The Custom house fell into their hands which had in Cash $60,000: 
the National Bank and other deposits in the palace furnished the 
balance. Some Forty or fifty thousand dollars of this money be- 
longed to the President. With all these means the Federals capitu- 
lated on yesterday, The Centrals conceding only life. Urea and 
Gomas Fareas, dastardly cowards, run away, leaving the soldiers to 
shift for themselves. This morning the soldiers more spunky than 
their run-away leaders, refused to Surrender: but imder promise of 
an immediate change in the Constitution have retired from the palace 
some ten miles distant under the guaranty of the Central Leaders 
that they shall not be molested. The Government is bound by treaty 
to send them their cannon (6 or 8) pieces from Six to Eight pound- 
ers, and to furnish them with provisions. The change they ask is 
not exactly Federal, but it has not yet appeared, and therefore I am 
unable to say what the change they ask may be. If Grovemment 
does not comply these six or eight hundred men will have to rob 
their way to some Federal town. The Militia that were with them 
and some French and Americans early this morning slipped out and 
have been lost among the crowd. Strangers in general curse the 
Federals for their chicken-heartedness, not having made a rush upon 
the enemy: but the officers are the cowards of this people; and a 
more pitiful set of cowards I have never seen. The Centrals were 
afraid to make an assault likewise, and thus they fought from be- 
hind walls of houses, banks of sand, and bales of cotton, until the 
principal houses above the Square have been much injured. Some

parts of the palace is much broken, in fact the injury sustained by 
the citizens by the havoc that has been made, including loss of goods 
pilfered will call for a Million of dollars to place the city as it was 
before this war. The battle commenced at ten minutes before Two 
on the 15th. and the firing of muskets, the thundering of cannon, 
and whistling of bombs, have continued more or less every day and 
night until yesterday 10.<* Nearly all the windows are shattered to 
pieces in Eight Streets leading to the palace, every man's sign is 
riddled, the City Lamps shattered, and store doors splintered to 
pieces. I cannot describe to you the awful state in which the city 
has been, during this time; only imagine to yourself the state in 
which a crowded city must be in,, with two enraged armies firing at 
each other from every house and through every street. The citizens 
had no time to escape, many were killed in endeavouring to fly 
from houses which were unable to withstand balls of the cannon; 
others dies from shots received in crossing streets or their flight to 
safer retreats, and some out of curiosity to see what was going on. 

Among the soldiery owing to their fighting from behind walls, 
they have not I presiune lost from their lists, wounded [and] killed 
ov«r four hundred men. This affair I am almost certain will put an 
end to their marching against Texas; even of thinking of it. No 
means left now — ^all at loggerheads, pulling and hauling robbing and 
killing. How is it possible that this people should be able to do 
anything. Let the Texans take courage, there will be no danger; 
You may invite emigrants to go and Settle, giving, them every as- 
surance that they will not be molested by the Mexicans. Why, 
Dear Sir, I am from what I have seen in this Siege, fully confirmed 
in the belief, that a wise and experienced American General with 
ten thousand brave American Riflemen, with Eight Sixteen pounders, 
may with ease march to this City, take it, and hold it, in spite of 
all the Mexicans could do. 

1st. Such men would bring a formidable terror with them. 

2nd. Strangers of every nation would join them, with as many 
Mexicans ; therefore you may consider Texas free from danger, and 
receive my sincerest wishes, etc. 

Notes. 

Santa Ana was sent for but has not arrived ; is within thirty miles. 
General Valencia is Commander in Chief. Filasola is at liberty, the 
President was set at liberty the 2d. day as Conciliator. It is sup- 
posed that Bustamente will not be permitted to retake the chair. 
Valencia will take advantage of the present, and the worst is to be 
feared.

Tonight, the mob has been very troublesome, and all afternoon, 
only to steal. ^Vhat a people ! they ought to have an Iron hearted 
King to rule them. Fit, db you say, this people to live under a 
Republic of their own ; so am I fit to be a second George Washington^ 
Santa Ana is going to be a sore eye here. The palace alone has 
sustained an injury of $50000. The Captain of the Steamboat 
Argyle had nearly sold his boat to the Government the 2d. day 
previous to the Revolution. Urea and Fareas, are no doubt still in 
this city, hid : they have made their thousands, but they acted honor- 
ably in reference to the safety of private property, and were so 
mild in their requests from the Central party, that almost every 
Stranger loved them, but their cowardice has bereft them of many 
friends. The Federals offered a five hundred dollars, to each good 
American Rifleman — four thousand (query " forty "«) dollars is s^ 
apart for said purpose, and I have understood that a few Americans 
have lined their pockets in shooting Centrals, but they must now 
look out for breakers. Poor Mr. Treat ! I have not seen him for the 
last fifteen days, owing to the accursed firing in the streets. I Kjiow 
nothing of Canales. Arista was in Tampico it is said, when the 
news of the Revolution reached there, and he fled to Matamoras, 
having narrowly escaped a trap set to catch him. The republic of 
Mexico will be a greater scene of havoc and war, from this out, for 
some months or years, than it has been since the Revolution of their 
Independence. 

The Indian Cherokee is gone home by way of Vera Cruz ;*' he says 
that he will not fight for the Mexicans, and that all he wished for, 
was their lands. Valencia, it is thought, will have Bustamente put 
down, and be Lord himself. Valencia wishes a military power; this 
was communicated to Urea and Fareas; they discovered themselves 
betrayed, as the petty officers began to think they would do better 
•under a Military power than a Federal power. This we are given 
to understand was the cause of Urea and Fareas' disappearing. The 
people expect the worst, and three different parties, it is expected,

understand the Government troops went (2. or 300) to receive their 
arms, when lo the Federals let loose upon them and the Centrals 
were routed. They have some one at their head some Say Urea 
himself, some say Andrada has come back to them. Santa. Ana, is 
said to be at Something the Centrals do not like. Never was this 
City in such a state of Consternation and wonder. Prisoners are 
brought in from all quarters. Strangers of all Nations have been 
for Urea, particularly so the French and Americans, of the former 
several have already been taken, and I fear the worst for some of the 
Americans. 

No provision has been made in the meagre capitulation for stran- 
gers, and no mercy will be shewn to those who have taken part in the 
Revolution if apprehended. I have understood some Americans have 
made their escape. The French Minister swears wrath against the 
Government if they shoot his people — ^but what can he do? Our 
Minister here I think holds his head a little too high, and I believe 
he will not bother himself much about us. For my part, I hope to 
be able to pass through and have no need of him ; but in case I have 
to suffer only for being a stranger, which we dread, I will seek refuge 
from some other power. I called once on Ellis, our Minister and he 
kept me waiting at his door so long as to shake my confidence in 
him, and at last only could see him by chance as he had to pass out.

This is the last note, I shall be able to give you, owing to the Mail 
leaving. We are yet all consternation. The Federals have not sur- 
rendered, they remain still in the Mill four leagues off. They were 
fighting with the Centrals all this morning, and it is not an hour 
ago when I could hear the firing of Cannon in rapid Succession. A 
hundred tales are going the rounds. Andrada I believe is in the mill. 
Urea and Fareas is no doubt not far off Some say Urea is at the 
head of two hundred Cavalry in an adjoining Mountain. 

Several of the Americans are said to be in jail, several French 
likewise. The French Minister has declared that his people shall 
be protected or he will leave for France. 

Give us such a Minister, we might crow, but it is said our minister 
is very slow to practise with rigor. 

I have sent you three papers; that of the Government is I think 
harsh and boasting, and many things in a great measure imtrue. 
The other is more fair, but has been afraid to speak, as they have to 
deal with conquerors. 

I cannot give you the amount of the dead ; I find there were more 
killed than I expected ScMne were found with their heads cut off, 
and the heads missing; Even the dogs yesterday were found devour- 
ing the dead.

[Wbight to Bbb.«] 

Mexico Avgust 18. 1840. 
Dear Sir, 

When- 1 last wrote you, the revolution had just ceased, with the 
exception of the Soldiers who had left the palace. They finally 
surrendered. Genl. Urea and Gomas Fareas it is believed are still in 
this city. They presented [their petition] by Attorney for a pardon. 
I must inform you that the whole affair is now known to have been a 
speculation, and several have no doubt enriched themselves in the 
Capitulations of the Eevolution. I am hardly* sorry to say that 
the Mexican people in general have an inkling after wealth and 
aggrandizement, however low, mean or ungentlemanly may be the 
road they may have to pursue. Treachery is as conmion as morning 
succeeds morning. Brother will betray brother. Father his son; 
and the pretended patriot for a thousand doubloons, will sell the 
country. The Country is at present like a hive of bees ; no one now 
likes to travel ; thieves are as numerous as the stars — the City is in 
an unsettled state; skirmishes of small importance are an almost 
daily occurrence, between federal and the central troops; and lives 
are too fequently wantonly destroyed. 

The Centrals are again established in power; are making rapid 
strides to obtain absolute power; they have received from Guana- 
juata last week 800 men of different arms in order I suppose to be 
more safe. 

I wrote you that it was very probable that the revolt would render 
this people so feeble as never to think more of Texas; but you will 
hardly believe me that the question relative to subduing Texas was 
the order of the day in the palace last week. There is no under- 
standing this people. I see that the Secretary of War of Texas has 
called that people to arms,<^ supposing General Arista east of the 
Rio Grande, and that Indians were gathered in a body to mardi 
upon the settlements. The first is not true ; however anxious Arista 
may have been to march into that country. That the intention of 
this Government has been to invade that Country there is no doubt, 
but their internal broils has prevented the invasion. The Cumanches 
etc I informed you some time since ^^ were moving on towards San 
Antonio, but was not certain as to their views — ^but must again say, 
Beware of the Savage, you are never Safe within reach of him. My 
advice is as yet to make no peace with them ; Suffer no missionaries

to go among them until they are reduced beyond the probability of 
committing further hostilities. Have the priests of Mexico ever 
succeeded? or the Vice Kings from Spain? Let Texas be wise, 
and shew no mercy, when that mercy will or would in all proba- 
bility return with tenfold vengeance upon her devoted citizens. 

Santa Ana is expected by some to come to rule, it is however only 
a rumor. I have just learned that two Mexican Schooners have been 
chased into Vera Cruz by a black Brig of War, said to be a Texian ; 
also, that on the 10th. firing of Cannon was heard out in the Gulph ; 
and that a Mexican vessel not having come in in time is probably a 
prey. Please be so good as to write me and inform me of particu- 
lars so as to Know what to do. I know that the Texan fleet is out 
but know not the intention. I believe Texas may be quiet as no 
invading power can at present invade her territory, you will if in 
case ** be informed. Mr. Treat is still hammering away to make his 
negociation; he might as well talk to the moon and preach to the 
stars. 

Two Americans are yet in prison, being suspected of having taken 
part with the Federals on the 18th. July. Many French have also 
been taken ; poor strangers have been left out of the Treaty to shift 
for themselves; this will be a good lesson for strangers, not to take 
part with the Mexican. It was abominable in the Federals to leave 
their friends, the strangers, who assisted them beyond the reach of 
their treaty. May he who again assists them share a better fate.

Sir. 

I have the honor to wait on You herewith, with duplicate of my 
last respects of 11th. inst., which was accompanied by a despatch to 
Gen : Lamar of same date, and to which, with the duplicates therein 
enclosed^ I beg leave, most respectfully, to refer the President, and 
also the Department I have the honor to address, for the particulars 
of Events here, up to my latest date. 

I have now the honor to acknowledge the reception of your highly 
valued despatch dated at Galveston City 13th. June, which I have 
carefully examined, and shall be governed by its contents, so far as 
circumstances and sound policy will permit, in bringing to a close 
the objects involved in my Mission. 

I submitted your communication to the perusal of Mr. Pakenham, 
^who was evidently much gratified with its contents, and with whom I 
have, thus far, had the good fortune to concur in every thing of any 
moment, touching the course I have pursued in the execution of my 
Mission.

vertently delayed four daya^ and four days more^ which in the course 
of Post^ brought it to hand orJy on the ISth.j which deprived me of 
the possibility of transmitting a letter to C!om : Moore within the 13 
days, which you name as the period, which one of the Squadron 
would await my despatch. The method pointed out, to Send my 
advices to the Fleet, (supposing one of them to be in the position you 
name) through neutral Vessels, outward bound from Vera Cruz, is 
necessarily very precarious^ as such a Service is always very re- 
luctantly undertaken by Captains, in consequence of the very possible 
responsibility of vitiating Insurance^ by a deviation from the direct 
and legitimate voyage^ to say nothing of the annoyance of the Mexi- 
can authorities, should they be discovered. 

It has, however, so happened, that I had nothing of much interest 
to communicate, either to the Gvmt. or the Commodore, at the present 
moment, as I am still awaiting the result of the question of Extraor- 
dinary Powers^ on which the present Ministry will Stand or fall. 

In case I had anything favourable to a friendly issue of my mission 
to Send out, the Gvmt. would, I think, permit me to do it openly; hut^ 
if I wished to advise an unfavourable close of my mission, it is not 
to be expected that they would facilitate my object, but rather 
oppose it. 

Under date of 19th. inst. I prepared a communication in the form 
of a Memorandum, and Yesterday sent it to the Secretary of State, 
transmitted through Mr. Pakenham, who took occasion to recommend 
the subject to the consideration of this Gvmt. I adopted this Chan- 
nel^ as I. was satisfied it would gain strength, and, at the same time, 
be more acceptable to the Gvmt. 

I hand you a copy enclosed of said paper, for the information of 
the President and the Department. In framing this document, I 
had the following objects in view. To give course to the contents of 
your letter, and so far fulfil the instructions of the Department as to 
apprize the Gvmt. of the complaints of Texas, as well as her Views^ 
wishes, and present pacific and neutral attitude. To cover, more or 
less, the whole ground of the present position of your Gvmt, and by 
bringing the whole subject anew, as it were, before the Gvmt., to 
shew the necessity of som^ immediate action on their part. 

I made it not so strong as I might have done, in view of your late 
despatch, but as energetic and pointed as I thought good policy and 
the present position of things rendered expedient, and with a View 
to promote our tdtimate objects. 

How far I have succeeded in combining the various objects in View, 
and how far it may be Satisfactory to the President and Department, 
I must wait to know, but I crave, in its behalf, your indulgent con- 
sideration.

686 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIOK. 

I have shewed the rough draft to Mr. Pakenham, who assured me 
there was not a sentence in it he would wish to amend. At his re- 
quest, I furnished him my draft to make a Copy, which, I doubt not, 
will be forwarded to Lord Palmerston by the proximate packet, to 
Sail frc«n Vera Cruz 24th. inst. 

I anticipate, that this Memorandum^ together with the verbal con- 
versations previously had on the same topics with the Secretary, in 
which I expressed myself plainly and Explicitely, will produce Some 
Action on the part of Gvmt., which, if not exactly conclusive^ will 
enable me to judge, with more certainty than I can at this moment, 
what their present intentions realty are. What I regret is that the 
result of its effects will not be in time for this commimication. The 
Gvmt. may take it in dtidgeon^ as a document too plain and cate- 
gorical for Rebels to present to their Legitimate Govmnt when sue- 
ing for Peace and Recognition^ but. Should they do so, it will be a 
mere pretext to dodge the question. 

I beg leave further to remark, in reference to my Memorandum^ 
that it was necessary to take into consideration that it would be laid 
before the Cabinet and President, and perhaps the Council and Con- 
gress, and hence, the necessity, or Expediency of couching it in re- 
spectful and moderate terms, to avoid exciting the fcdse pride of 
Some, and the hereditary notions of national honor of others. Hence 
also I thought it good policy to exonerate the Gvmt., indirectly, from 
having authorized or directed the petty hostilities complained of, in 
your letter and m,y memorandum. 

As regards the interrogatories contained in your Commujiication, 
it is difficult to reply to them categorically or Satisfactorily at the 
present moment, and, as I am situated ; but a general answer may be 
infered, by the tenor of my present and late advices. I will, how- 
ever remark that the vicinity of the Squadron has produced no 
palpable, or visible effects, thus far, either favourable or otherwise, 
on the part of the Gvmt. or in the public mind. This may be 
attributed to the agitated State of public affairs, and the fact that 
only one of the Schooners has been yet se^ or reported. 

Two Mexican Coasters which sailed from Vera Cruz on the 8th. 
inst. returned next day, and reported that they had been chased by 
a suspicious two-Topsail schooner, and were informed by another 
coasting Craft, which had been hoarded by said Schooner, that she 
was a Texian. This is the report of the Va. Cruz papers. The 
authorities of Va. Cz. took the declarations of the Captains of the 
two Mexican Crafts, and forwarded them to Gvmt. These decla- 
rations, the Secretary of State informed me. Stated " that the Texian 
Schooner had capiAired one of the coasters, but gave me no con-

finnatory details. This Matter of Capture, I denied most positi/oely^ 
as having been made by Com. Moore or any part of his Vessels, tmless 
indeed^ in Violation of orders, which was not, for a mom,&nt^ to be 
presumed. Private letters say, that the Schooner took some brandy 
from the Vessel boarded, and do not add that they paid for it as is 
no doubt the fact if the Story be true. 

All these are vague rumours, but Enough for the Gvmt. to harp 
upon, and are calculated to produce delay and suspicion. Hence my 
positive declaration that the object of the Squadron was pacific, 
pending my Mission. Hence also the Suggestions, at the close of 
my Memorandum, of removing the apprehensions of the Mexicans on 
the coast as regards capture, and the use of Sacrificios by Com: 
Moore, under the guarantee of hospitality and protection. If they 
should grant it, which I rrmst doubt, I would, if I can get a letter 
to the Commodore, suggest the use of the offer of this Gvmt., and, 
of course, leave him to decide whether his instructions or his duty 
would be interfered with, by such a course. The only benefit, by 
sending in a Schooner, for instance, would be that He could receive 
my despatches, and convey them to the Gvmt. of the Commodore, 
whenever they were of importance or decisive of my Mission, and the 
further advantage of Shewing to the public that the Gvmt. are enter- 
taining some arrangement with me, and willing pro tern to be on 
good te(rms with us. 

I am indebted for your instructions as regards a Truce, and I 
think, as well as Mr. Pakenham, that if I fail in the Treaty, I may 
obtain a Truce. How long it will require is very uncertain, but I 
ought to get all I shall ever get in a month ; less, if unsuccessful ; and, 
perhaps, more, if we have to adjust a Treaty, or Truce, either of 
which will require some details^ and they are so everlastingly slow 
in all their movements. 

I shall, therefore, under the discretion the President has thought 
proper to confide to me, wait a reasonable time, according to circum- 
stances, and endeavour to carry out my instructions, (unless the door 
is closed against ttz/^) hut no longer than I can entertain a recssonable 
prospect of some success. 

The foregoing is all I can now state for the information of the 
President and the Department I have the honor to address. 

Mr. Pakenham expressed himself entirely Satisfied with your reply 
to his business, as regards the Vessels in question. I note what You 
Say as regards Yucatan^ and Shall bear the Subject in mind. 

I hand you a Copy of my letter to Com. Moore; but it is very 
doubtful if it reaches him, tho' I shall endeavour to effect the object, 
if possible; if not, it will reach the Department.

Texas 



MElfORANDUM. 

The Confidential Agent of the Govt, of Texas, having received 
recent official advices from that Govt, deems it his duty to submit to 
the consideration of the Govt, of Mexico the following facts and 
observations. 

The Govt, of Texas assures the said agent of its continued and 
earnest desire for peace, which has been so long and fully evinced, 
not only by an entire suspension of hostilities, for a long period, but 
also, and more especially, by its strict and rigid perseverance in the 
neutral, and friendly course it adopted more than a year since. The 
said Govt, also assures its Agent, in the most positive and vnqualified 
terms ^ that it has, during the above period, constantly a*nd unhesi- 
tatingly refused all manner of aid, countenance, or co-operation 
either direct or indirect, with the forces which in opposition to the 
Mexican Govt, have at different times and under different Chiefs 
assembled on the Northern frontiers of Mexico, and have further- 
more taken the most active measures to prevent the enlistment of 
Texian Volunteers under said chiefs, as is already known to the 
Govt, of Mexico. If it has not been entirely able to prevent this 
evil, it has to a great extent lessened it, and, at least, manifested, by 
its efforts, its disposition to avoid any just cause of offence to Mexico. 

With the repeated threats of the Mexican Officers on the frontiers 
of a proximate invasion of Texas, confirmed in some degree by ap- 
parent preparatory measures of Govt, and the long delay of the 
Agent of Texas in Mexico, without having been able thus far to give 
any positive or satisfactory assurance of a friendly arrangement of 
existing difficulties between the two Countries, it is not strange that 
Texas should be preparing itself for Events. 

Thence the assembling of a respectable force on the frontier of the 
country but to act, for the present^ merely on the dsfensive^ to pre- 
serve its long professed neutrality, and stationed within its own 
borders. Hence also the present cruise in the Gulf of a portion of its

Navy (after having remained in port, armed and equipped for Serv- 
ice, nearly a year) but with instructions to the Commander to act on 
the defensive only, and to commit no act of hostility against Mexico, 
So long as negotiations are open and pending between the Govt, of 
Mexico and the Agent of Texas. 

It affords the Agent of Texas the utmost satisfaction, thus to be 
enabled to assure the Govt, of Mexico in the most positive and Solemn 
manner of the entire good faith of the Govt, of Texas, in all the fore- 
going facts and declarations, but at the same time, the said Agent 
would not fulfil his obligations to the Govt of Texas, nor his duty to 
himself, if he omitted to State the Evils of which the Govt, of Texas 
complains. 

Altho the Govt, of Mexico has not recently invaded Texas by any 
regular armed force, yet Texas has long been, and still, is, suffering 
* from the frequent incursions of small predatory and marauding 
parties, who traverse the frontier of the coimtry, and commit depre- 
dations on the defenceless frontier population. This is an evil which 
the Govt, of Texas feels they cannot any longer submit to ; and this, 
probably, is another reason for sending an armed force to the lines, 
to protect the inhabitants of the borders from these vexatious incur- 
sions which can have no national object, and the result of which is 
usually plunder, on the one hand, and exasperated and vindictive 
feelings, on the other. 

The Govt, of Texas also complain that Mexican Officers or Agents 
have been and still are engaged in Exciting the Indians, both within 
and without the limits of Texas, to commit hostilities and depreda- 
tions against the people of Texas. This is calculrted to keep the 
frontiers of the country in a constant state of alarm, and Compels that 
Govt, to keep a respectable force of mounted Rangers traversing the 
frontier Indian Settlements. This is a serious anoyance, attended 
with much expense to the Govt, and, as in the former case (as the 
inducements of the Indians is plunder) productive of no possible 
national good, but much evil. The Govt, of Texas does not assent 
that these acts emanate from, or are sanctioned by the Govt, of 
Mexico, but they are nevertheless evils of a serious nature, and from 
which they think they ought to be exempt; at least during the 
pendency of amicable negociations, and while that Govt, sustains the 
neutral and friendly attitude, she has heretofore, and up to the present 
time, continued to observe. 

The Agent dismisses this topic, which he has referred to reluctently, 
and only from a sense of duty, in the fulfillment of instructions, and 
to avert the continuance of the evils adverted to.

The Agent concludes by observing that he hopes what is herein 
stated, together with what was previously known to the Govt of 
Mexico, will show conclusively and satisfactorily: 

That the Govt, of Texas ever has been and still is sincere in its 
pacific declarations: That it prefers Peace to V^ar: That it desires 
still a friendly arrangement of existing dificulties with Mexico: 
That the measures she has adopted during the past year, and the 
continuance of the Agent here during the period of more than eight 
months, awaiting the action and decision of the Gk>vt. of Mexico, 
will amply prove the constancy and perseverance, with whidi she has 
sustained an absolutely neutral attitude, and prosecuted her pro- 
posed plan of obtaining a peace, through friendly n^ociations, rather 
than a resort to further hostilities : That the sacrifices she has already 
made to secure the blessing of peace cannot be ccMitinued indefinitely : 
and finally that it is for the Govt, of Mexico now to decide what shall 
be the future relaticm between the people of the two Countries: 
whether friends or enemies. 

The Agent would most respectfully suggest that the evils which 
must result from an apprehensicm on the Coast that Mexican Vessels 
are exposed to be captured by the Texian Squadron, now in the 
Gulf, might be remedied by the Govt, making known officially that 
the subject of the Squadron is of a Specific diaracter and that they 
can therefore proceed to sea as heretofore without any ri^ of Cap- 
ture, as already before stated. And the Agent further remarks that, 
if the Govt, of Mexoo, will proffer the hospitality and protection of 
its waters Say the Roadstead of sacrificios to the Texian Vessels of 
War, the Agent will invite Com. Moore who commands the Texian 
Squadron to avail of this offer, and thus allay all aprehension of 
any immediate hostilities. 

The Agent Most Respectfully sulHuits the preceding facts and 
observations to the omsideration of the Presidoit of Mexico, with 
an Earnest desire that they may receive that omsideration which 
the Agent believes their intrinsic importance will justly entitle 
them to.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 691 

By this communication, I am apprized of your being in the Gulf 
with some three or four Vessels of War under your orders, and infer 
that you was in the vicinity of the port of Vera Cruz about the 4th 
inst. as my despatch was received in Vera Cruz on the 5th. but 
imfortunately was inadvertently delayed there three or four days, 
which, with four days post route^ delayed its reception here until the 
13th. inst. 

This I very much regretted, as it deprived me of the possibility 
of placing a letter in your hands within the thirteen days named in 
my despatch as the period which you would await my conmiunica- 
tion in reply, after the delivery of my despatch in Vera Cruz. 

Beside the method of conveying my advices to you pointed out in 
my letter from the Department of State is necessarily very precarious^ 
as no Master of a Merchant Vessel, (or very few) would be willing 
to incur the possible responsibility of a deviation from their legiti- 
mate voiage, by taking despatches to be delivered at Sea, and perhaps 
the further risk of trouble from the Govt, should they return here, 
and the fact be known. Consignees bf Vessels in Vera Cruz, I am 
persuaded, would, in most instances, object to it, and Capts would 
undoubtedly consult them. You, of course, have not the same dif- 
ficulties to contend with, in sending in letters to me under cover to the 
British Minister. 

The only way I could remedy this difficulty, in case my despatches 
to you, or to the Gvmt. were highly important, would be to send out 
from Vera Cruz a small Craft expressly, and, of course, by permission 
of the Gvmt. which would onZy^roTi.^i^, if my advices were favourable 
to a continuance of peaceable relations. If for instance, I wished to 
inform you that my negotiations were broken off without any favour- 
able result, the Gvmt. would not of course, facilitate my communica- 
tion with you. 

In the latter case, I should leave immediately for Vera-Cruz and 
should manage to find you, or one 'of your Squadron, if then in the 
vicinity, when the transmission of a despatch would be very doubtful. 

As it is, however, I am in doubt what will be your course after the 
lapse of thirteen days,eLnd you recieve nothing from me: whether you 
will leave the vicinity with the whole of the squadron, or let one of 
them remain to recieve any thing that I may be able to send you, I am 
left to conjecture. 

My instructions require that I shall immediately apprize you in the 
Event of failing in my Mission, and this I should assuredly do, as 
soon as possible, either by letter, or in person, if I knew that one of 
your Vessels would be in the position named in my despatches, but 
when I shall obtain a final decision from this Gvmt. is yet doubtful. 

My Negotiations have been retarded, and are now, for the time 
being suspended, owing to the uncertain position of the Ministry, 
as it depends upon the results of legislative measures now in progress

whether they will resign or continue in office. This unsettled State 
of things arises from an attempt at Revolution, which took place in 
this Capital on the 15th. July, and continued undecided until the 
27th. of the Month, when it was quelled by the Grovmt. which up to 
the present time has not become so far settled and tranquilized as 
to be able to proceed with my business. Hence I cannot at this 
moment, say anything decisive, but must await Events, as they trans- 
pire which here are always slow, 

I hope however in the course of about a week I shall be able to 
judge (at least much better than I can at present) about Jiow long 
it may be before I reach a final decision, and whether that decision 
will he favourable to the continuance of peaceful Relations between 
the two Countries, or otherwise. 

Under these circumstances of doubt and uncertainty, and as my 
despatch from the Department says nothing of your movements 
after the thirteen days during which you would await my despatches, 
I very much regret that you did not honor me with a letter inform- 
ing me of your general movements, and particularly how long you, 
or any of your Squadron would probably remain in the neighbor- 
hood of Vera Cruz. This information would have aided me very 
much to keep up a communication with you during your stay in this 
quarter of the Gulf. 

I still however anticipate the pleasure of hearing from you soon, 
and hope you will have embraced the first opportunity of giving 
me such further information as will better enable me to execute my 
instructions in keeping you (and perhaps through you, the Gvmt) 
advised of my progress, up to the -fin^ issue of my mission.- 

I send you this by the English Packet, to sail from Vera-Cruz 
24th. inst. for the Havana. If she falls in with you, you wiU receive 
ity and with it a despatch for the Secretary of State, which please 
send forward, by the first of your Vessels that may be going to Gal- 
veston or New Orleans, or by any Vessels you may meet with bound 
to the latter Port. 

If it misses you^ all will go to the Department of State. If you 
send my despatch to N. Orleans Please place it under cover to your 
Consul to be forwarded immediately. This, my dear Sir, is ihe best 
course I can adopt to endeavour to reach you. 

The report of your being in the vicinity has reached here, by the 
return to Vera-Cruz of two Mexican Vessels on the 9th. inst which 
had sailed the day previous. They report that a suspicious Schooner 
had chased them^ and that they learned by another Me^can craft, 
that had been boarded that the Schooner was a Texian. They further- 
more state that the Schooner had captured a Mexican Vessel. 

This however must be a mistake without doubt. In view of my 
advices from Gvmt. I have not hesitated to assure this Government 
in the most positive maavner that your instructions were certainly of

a pacific character so long as my negotiations with the Government 
were open and pending. This was necessary or expedient to allay 
the excitement produced by the report of Your having captured a 
Mexican Vessel, Another Story is that some Brandy was taken from 
the Mexican Vessel to which I have replied that if any thing had been 
taken it was undoubtedly paid for^ and that the Commander had 
probably taken a receipt therefor, I have informed this Grovmt. 
that if they would offer you the protection and hospitality of their 
waters, I would invite you to send in one of your Vessels to Sacri- 
ficious. This might be attended with some advantages. I will, if 
I get a favourable reply^ further advise you (if I can manage to get 
a letter to you) when^ in view of what I shall then inform you, you 
can exercise your own discretion. 

I am in daily expectation of hearing from you, in which case I 
shall be the better able to send you my advices^ which I will Endeavor 
to do, at all Events^ so soon as I have anything of importance further 
to advise you.

afternoon; I wUl despatch the Schr. San Jacinto tomorrow to 
Gralveston with your accompanying three despatches, and a Copy of 
yours to me agreeably to your request. 

The Schr San Jacinto has been off this place since the SOtli. July 
hut has not captured any Vessel nor attempted to do so ; she chased 
two Schooners two days since, and on one of them standing in for the 
Land, with the view, as was supposed, of running her on shore, the 
chase was instantly abandoned to prevent injury to the Mexican 
property. I arrived off here with the Schr San Bernard in company, 
on the 18th. inst. and have had, since I left Galveston, favourable op- 
portunities of capturing seven or eight Mexican Vessels {three I have 
actually boarded) not one of which has been molested in any manner ! 
You were, therefore perfectly safe in giving the Mexican Grovem- 
ment the assurance that you did, and you may still rest perfectly 
assured, that so long as your negotiations are " open^'* and " pending^'* 
no Mexican Vessel will be molested by any Vessel of the Texas Navy 
until I receive additional instructions from my Government. 

I would have written to you myself sooner but supposed that the 
letter from the Honble the Secretary of State had given you all the 
information, respecting my movements, that was necessary. 

In order that you may without fail communicate with me, or with 
my government through one of the Vessels under my command you 
may be certain of either finding this Ship or one of the other Vessels 
of the Squadron off Point Mariandrea within twenty miles of the 
Land. 

I cannot see any benefit that could possibly accrue from having 
one of the Vessels of our Navy at anchor at Sacraficious and if it be 
necessary I can anchor this Ship within four miles of Vera Cruz 
without the " protection " or " hospitality " of the Mexican Govern- 
ment but in defiance of their whole force ! ! My instructions prevent 
my appearing off any of the Mexican Ports at present. 

I am in anxious expectation of hearing defirdtely^ from you at an 
early date and hope most sincerely that the Mexican Government 
will acknowledge us at once, which it is certainly her interest to do.

Dear Sir 

I send by the same Vessel that takes this to Galveston a letter to 
you and two to the Honble A. S. Lipscomb from Mr. Treat our 
Agent in Mexico; also a full report to the Honble the Secretary of 
the Navy of my movements since the 22d July at which time I last 
wrote, with copies of a letter received from Mr. Treat and my reply. 
By reference to my report you will see the disposition of tiie Fed- 
eralists of Yucatan towards the Government of Texas and their 
anxiety for the cooperation of our Naval force; the weight of which, 
thrown at this time on their side would, I feel confident, be the means 
of establishing the Federal Constitution throughout Mexico, when 
we would be acknowledged at once. 

The Centralists are allmost prostrate, and single handed with the 
means already at your Command (the Navy) you might, without the 
least prospect of being molested by them on the Frontier, dictate 
to, and no longer ajsik at their hands, that which they can be very 
soon made to feel is ours already, viz our perfect Independence of 
them ; and in my humble opinion they will never acknowledge it until 
they are made to feel it. 

. With the Navy manned as indifferently as it is, every Mexican Ves- 
sel can be captured that dare put to sea, and their whole Sea Coast 
be kept in a perfect state of fear and trembling; why then should we 
temporize any longer with them, when, if they had the power they 
would annihilate every male Inhabitant of Texas and spead devas- 
tation and ruin throughout our devoted Country.

Moore to Lipscomb.^ 

28th. August 1840 
Texas Sloop of War Austin 
At Sea Lat 25 05 N 
Long 96 34 W 
Sir 

I recieved on the morning of the 25th inst a communication from 
Mr. James Treat bearing date 21st Aug and enclosing two letters to 
you and one to his Excellency the President, which are herewith 
enclosed, together with a Copy of Mr. Treat's letter and a Copy of 
my reply which I wrote immediately and put on-board the San 
Bernard to be sent in by the first opportunity and made sail at once 
in the direction of Galveston on my way to the Brazos De Santiago, 
with the San Jacinto in company intending so soon as my despatches 
are all written to send her on with them and meet me again off Point 
Mariandrea. 

From the tenor of Mr. Treat's letter I am under the full conviction 
that we will never bring the Mexican Government to terms by Treat- 
ing] backed even as we are, and as they are now assured by Mr Treat 
that our Vessels wiU not molest theirs, so long as his negotiations are 
" open " and " pending " they will of course keep them so as long as 
they can possibly find a pretext, and it will not be long before their 
Vessels will be running by ours, and they on board laughing at us. 

To obviate the difficulty that Mr Treat is labouring under in send- 
ing his despatches out, if his negotiations are still to be kept " open " 
and " pending " I would most respectfully suggest that I may be per- 
mitted to Cruize off and close to the Castle of St Juan de Ulloa; and 
board every Vessel, not Mexican, that sails from Vera-Cruz ; by this 
course Mr. Treat would not have much, if any difficulty, in getting 
Capts of merchant Vessels to take charge of a letter for me as the 
Mexican Authorities could not possibly know by what Vessel I re- 
ceived a communication; and in the event of his negotiation being 
broken off, which I hope will be the case soon unless we are at once

recognized, Mr. Treat could easily get on board of one of the Vessels, 
not having to pull more than four or five miles. 

With all due deference, I cannot refrain from the expression of the 
opinion that we have temporized too long already ; and if we let them 
see that we really are in earnest, by capturing their Vessels and an- 
noying their Sea Coast ; which we can do with our Naval force, to at 
least some extent, I cannot but believe that they will very soon come 
to terms. I have no faith in their promises, unless they feel that they 
can be forced to keep them ; — ^The whole history of their negotiations 
is strong proff of this position. 

By my report to the Honble the Secretary of the Navy which goes 
also by the San Jacinto, you will see that the Authorities of the State 
of Yucatan are, or profess to be our Friends; at all events their Ports 
are open to any Texan Vessel and they are anxious for the co-oper- 
ation of our Naval force. 

At all events I hope something will be done before the meeting of 
Congress and our present supply of Provisions and Stores are ex- 
hausted. The fate of our little Navy depends on the issue. 
I have the honor to be

letter, which I addressed to Commodore Moore, to aU which I beg 
leave to refer the Department and the President. 

The letter to the Commodore, I have good reas<Hi to think, readied 
him very luckily on the 24tli. Ulto. ; but as yet I have no reply from 
him, the Squadron having disappeared from Va. Cruz on the 26th. 
I also sent the Commodore despatches for your Department, and for 
the President, supposing he might soon be sending in one of his Ves- 
sels ; and some other despatches in Duplicate were forwarded at the 
same time, Via Havarui, The Kanhawa^ which sailed from Va. Cz. 
for New Orleans, changed her voyage suddenly^ and departed, before 
I had time to avail of her. No foreign Merchant Vessels had arived 
at Va. Cz., at last advises, since the 24th. ; but the first arrival diat 
we have I hope will bring me a letter from the Commodore, which 
will be most welcome, as I am entirely ignorant of his present and 
future movements, which, as I am now Situated, I should like much 
to know. 

A brief Sketch of Events which interest and relate to my Mission 
will suffice for this Communication. 

The Extraordinary Powers on which the Government relied to 
strengthen tiiemselves failed in the Senate, and the Cabinet, rather 
than resign, as they said they would, have modified their application 
for an Extension of Powers, in a New and double form, viz: those 
that Congress have power to grant, they ask from that body; and 
those beyond their province, are asked of the conservative power. 
This question is still pending, and the general opinion, in and out of 
Congress, is that both branches of the powers will pass both Houses 
of Congress, but that the Conservative power will refuse to accede, 
on its party to the call of Government supported by Congress. How- 
ever, with the additional powers they will receive from Congress, 
without the others refered to, the Gvmt. will go on, and Ministers 
hold their places, at least for the present. Among thesfe last powers 
is one authorizing gvmt. to borrow the Sum of Six million of Dollars 
to preserve the integrity of the National territory; to reorgamze a 
Navy^ on the basis of the project submitted by the Secretary of War 
some time since (of which I have already advised the Gvmt., in a 
former dispatch) and for other purposes. 

The project of Almonte to raise ways and means, to carry on the 
War by a direct contribution [which was] presented to the Chambers 
in December last, and after great delay and many amendments passed 
the Deputies and went to the Senate, where I supposed, after three 
Months delay, it would sleep forever, has been revived and passed 
that Body. 

The advices from the frontier are all more or less indicative of 
preparations, and the proclamation and decree of the Authorities of 
Sante F6, Shew, that even they are expecting an invasion from Texas.

COBBESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 699 

Since the appearance of the whole of the Squadron in Sight of 
Vera Cruz, several of the leading Journals are filled with abuse 
against Texas, and urging the Gvmt. to prepare for hostilities 
against Texas by providing for a Navy and increasing the Army. 

The official paper has abstained from publishing any thing what- 
ever on the subject imtil very recently, when it has republished 
several Articles of an unfriendly character. 

The Secretary took it much in dudgeon that Com: Moore had 
visited Campeche, and pretended that it was sufficient evidence of the 
insincerity and bad faith of Your Gvmt., and asserted that it had 
indisposed many persons, who were inclined to some arrangement 
with Ts. 

The Secretary also complained very bitterly of the Robbery^ 
proved (as he insisted — ) to have been committed by one of our 
Schooners, by the sworn declaration -of the Capt. of a Mexican 
Coaster, from whom had been taken a demijohn of Brandy, some 
three or four hundred pounds of brown Sugar, and some vegetables. 
I discovered that much Stress was laid upon these circiunstances, but 
mainly, as I thought, to justify further delay on the part of Gvmt. in 
urging the main Question submitted to Congress to some prompt 
desision. 

The Secretary, nevertheless, assured me that my Memorandum 
had gone to the Chambers, and thence to the C<Mnmittee on Texian 
Affairs, and that Said Committee were occupied with their report, 
which Gvmt, would accelerate all it could. I soon ascertained that 
these assurances were not true^ and came at once to the conclusion 
that Either Gvmt did not intend to bring forward the question of 
Texas a^ oB; or, not until it Suited their purpose; and I resolved 
to bring the matter to a point, and made up my mind that I would 
remain no longer in the prosecution of my Mission, unless I could 
obtain Satisfactory Assurance, and of a more formal character than 
any yet given me, that Gvmt. would at once take up the Matter 
Seriously^ and proceed to a friendly negotiation. Hence my second 
Memorandum, dated 5th. Inst, and delivered to the Secretary this 
day, a Copy of wfdch please find herewith. 

This will go to Congress forthwith, and it remains to be seen 
whether the Committee will report before the 18th. inst., and what 
they will recommend. My impression is that Gvmt. will not give 
me any Assurances which / shall deem satisfactory, and that by the 
20th. I shall ask for my Passport. 

As regards that branch of your instructions which authorizes an 
Armistice, from the moment I came in possession of the Presidents 
wishes on this point, I confered fully and freely with Mr. Pakenham, 
and there was an entire concurrence of opinion on the whole Subject 
To wit: that my policy was to carry through, and to some final issue

my present pending Negotiations, before presenting to the Gvmt 
his alternative or Option. 

They having refused to listen to my propositions for Peace, Recog- 
nition, Indemnity, etc, and pending my Passport, then Mr Paken- 
ham, as if at Jm own Suggestion^ in expressing his regret at the 
Ckmsequences that must ensue from a State of active hostilities, will 
Suggest, as the only possible way now to avoid them, a proposal of 
Armistice to me, and thus, by way of an apparent Suggestion of his 
own for their benefit and ccmsideration, introduce the proposition of 
an Armistice, which Mr Pm. will Strongly recommend and enforce. 

It was thought by Us both that, if the proposal came from me, it 
would be almost certain to be rejected without due Consideration. 
It is therefore my intention to adopt the course. So Soon as I can 
bring the other Matter to a point; and if the Gvmt. entertain the 
questicm of a Truce at all, I shall meet the question, and I ima^ne 
it will not require long to arrange the matter; and if they declinoe it 
altogether^ I shall take my leave immediately. 

I shall proceed to Vera Cruz, and then to New Oris, direct, if 
oppty presents and if not Via Havana or Pensacola. Should I not 
find any instructicms from your Department at New Orleans, I shall 
proceed forthwith to Gralveston, where I shall hope to find a Com- 
munication from You expressive of the wishes of the President as 
regards myself. Should I be able to meet any of the Vessels of the 
Squadron, I might be landed direct at Galveston. I shall endeavour 
to see Commodore Moore, should he be anywhere within my reach, 
or make Every EflFort to get a letter to him. 

Again refering the President and Department to the papers herein 
enclosed:

In the first place, the agent begs leave to refer to his Memorandmn, 
dated the 19th. Ultimo, transmitted through the Hon. Bichard Paken- 
ham, and now has the honor to State, in dlZ good faith and with 
entire frankness and directness of purpose, [it] is not less true now, 
in*any one respect. The Agent understands that this paper has been 
placed before the (Chamber of Deputies for their Consideration, when 
the subject is presented for discussion. 

The Agent is unwilling to believe that any of the acts attributed 
to the C!ommanders of the Texian Vessels of War now on a pacific 
cruize in the Gulf should have produced in the minds of H. E. the 
President, or his Cabinet, any change, unfavorable to an amicable 
termination of existing differences, and much less can he suppose 
that these occurrences can, for a moment, be made the basis of a 
charge of insincerity or bad faith against the Government of Texas. 
The Agent cannot perceive why a friendly and neutral Visit of the 
Squadron to Campeche should give rise to any complaint on the part 
of Mexico, as it does not appear that any arrangement was entered 
into, and if a friendly, and even flattering [welcome] was extended 
to the Commodore, and his flag saluted, this was done by the authori- 
ties of Yucatan! Hence Texas has done no more than She had a 
right to do, without at all affecting her friendly negotiations with 
Mexico. 

As regards the charge against the Captain of one of the Texian 
Schooners, as stated in the declaration of the Captain of a Mexican 
Coasting Vessel, that some Brandy and Sugar was taken from his 
Vessel, the Agent regrets to say, that this charge raay he true, and yet 
he is strongly inclined to believe that, if Compensation was not re- 
ceived, it was offered and refused. But, admitting the entire truth 
of the above named declaration, while the act must be admitted by all 
to merit the most severe reprehension, yet it would not be just nor 
reasonable to inculpate the Government of Texas, in a matter so 
insignificant in itself, and so remote from all its recent acts towards 
Mexico. 

If the charge be true, the punishment of the oflfcer Committing 
this Violation of his instructions or his duty; the restoration of the 
Value of the property, and satisfactory explanation to the Govern- 
ment of Mexico, is certainly, all that any Government could require, 
or expect from an offence by a mere Subaltern, committed in the 
absence of his Superior Officer. This satisfaction and redress, the 
Agent pledges himself, the Government of Texas will be prompt to 
make, should tJie charge he suhstantiated. 

Besides, the general instructions, under which it is now fully 
shown, (with the only exception of this alleged offence) that Com- 
modore Moore has acted up to the present time, viz. Not to make 
any captures, nor commit any act of hostility against Mexico so long

as negociations were pending in Mexico^ precludes the possibility 
that the Government of Texas should approve the act alluded to, 
and much lessy that it should have authorized it 

The Agent, therefore hopes and believes that these circumstances 
will not in any degree lessen or destroy any favorable disposition 
which may have previously existed on the part of the Government, or 
the Congress of Mexico, to listen to the propositions which the Gov- 
ernment of Texas, through its Agent, has authorized to be made; and 
FiNALLT that the Government of Mexico should now determine 
whether the result of several years pacific and friendly policy, and 
one years earnest and constant solicitation for an amicable arrange- 
ment on the part of Texas, should at last result in a renewal of 
hostilities. 

// so^ the Agent of Texas must, on behalf of that Government 
protest against any and all responsibility on its part for the Conse- 
quences and evils which may ensue from a State of things, which 
She has so constantly and so earnestly sought to avert. 

Texas, in this sad and undesired events will await the Verdict of 
an impartial World, in the almost certainty of an entire justification. 

The Agent would not omit to observe that he has seen with regret, 
and duly considered, the situation of the Capital during the latter 
part of the Month of July, and the Consequent embarrassment and 
diflBculty which the Government has since had to contend with in 
the despatch of public business. At the same time, however, the 
Agent is compelled to say that he has very nearly exhausted all the 
discretion which the Government of Texas has granted him, as re- 
gards prolonging his Stay in Mexico, and especially since up to the 
present mroment he has not been officially authorized, to make a single 
declaration of a favorable character to that Government. 

The Government of Mexico have said they would hear any Agent 
from Texas^ before any one appeared; and it is now nearly Nine 
Months since the present Agent arrived in Mexico, without yet hav- 
ing obtained an official hearing. 

He sees with regret that measures preparatory for an invasion of 
Texas are every where advocated, and that the Legislation of Con- 
gress tends clearly to the supposition that hostilities are preparing 
against that Country. 

In view then of all the declarations and assurances which the 
Agent has herein and heretofore made, in writing or verbally, 
through the friendly interposition of the British Minister and in 
further view of the actual position and present aspect of the ques- 
tions involved in his Mission, the Agent is compelled, however reluc- 
tantly, to State that he hopes and expects that on or before the 18ih 
inst. H. E. the President will be enabled to give some official or 
formal assurance of the final determination of this Government as

r^ards the object of his Mission, which may satisfy him of the 
actual intentions of the Government to enter forthwith upon an 
amicable Negotiation^ Otherwise^ the Agent will then deem it his 
imperative duty to ask most respectfully for his passport, and with- 
draw from his Mission. 

The Agent respectfully solicits that this exposition may be placed 
before the Hon the Chambers of Deputies without delay ^ that it may 
be annexed to the antecedent documents in relation to the same 
subject. 

The Agent, through the Medium of the Hon. Bichard Pakenham, 
most respectfully submits the foregoing remarks to H. E. the Presi- 
dent of the Republic of Mexico for his consideration and decision.

To James Tbeat Esqr 
Sib, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the Receipt of your despatches 
of the 11th to 21st August which came to hand, through Commodore 
Moore, all of which have been laid before his Excellency the Presi- 
dent. And I have the satisfaction to assure you, that he fully ap- 
proves the course you have adopted. I sincerely hope that before 
this reaches you, that, you may have been able to effect a favorable 
result, of your negotiation. If this, however should not be the case, 
and you should discover a disposition on the part of the Mexican 
Government to interpose unnecessary delay, not resulting from the 
legitimate action, and usages of their peculiar forms of business, you 
will on such a contingency, present the ultimatum by requiring an 
explicit and definitive action on your propositions, and bring your 
Agency to a close. 

One of our vessels of War, will be ordered down to Vera Cruz, for 
the purpose of conveying to you this despatch, and should you be 
able to effect the arrangement referred to in your last, to remain and 
openly communicate with you, for the purpose of facilitating your 
correspondence with the Govt. You will inform the Commander of 
the terms, on which such arrangement has been made. And in that 
event we shall expect to hear from you very soon; if not, you will 
have to avail yourself of the best means that may be presented in 
forwarding your despatches. I understand frcMn Commodore Moore,

Sir. 

In my last of the 7th inst. I apprized You of the Situation of 
my affairs here, and expressed a belief that, after aU^ I should effect 
no arrangement of any kind with this Gvmt. They are so weak 
and changeable, (independent of their deceptions^ but very Specious 
assurances — ) that it is very difficult to rely on anything whatever. 

You will perceive, by the tenor of my last and the papers therein 
enclosed ; ( — ^viz., a dupl : Copy of a Memorandum dated 19th. Augt, 
to the Gvmt, and an origl. Copy of another Memorandv/nv of the 6th.

I beg leave now to refer You to the papers herewith ; say : a copy of 
my last of 7th. inst., dupl : Memorandum of paper sent to Govt., dated 
6th. inst., and a Copy of my last Note demanding passport under 
date of 21th.<' inst

indemnity for certain limits,® to be hereafter fixed, the particulars of 
which / must omit for a future day. 

Pending the answer to my note of 21st inst, Mr Pakenham took oc- 
casion to suggest the idea of an armistice to Mr. Caiiedo, the Secretary 
of State, as the only means then left to avoid a conflict with Texas, 
and after some Conversation, it was understood that if I had powers 
to arrange an armistice, and was disposed to do so, they would re- 
ceive proposals, and act promptly upon them. I offered to receive 
any propositions that might be made touching the armistice, but de- 
clined making any myself^ and the result was that Mr. Pakenham 
was authorised to present the proposals I should authorize him to 
make to this Gvmt. I prepared a paper in accordance with the 
Views of Mr. Pakenham, which he presented, — (see Copy herewith 
dated 25th. inst — ) and it was laid by the Secretary of State before 
the President and Ministers and there discussed at two or more Ses- 
sions of the Cabinet, without authoriziiig the Secretary of State to 
give me or Mr. Pakenham any specific answer; and thus matters 
stood until this day, when the Secretary of State delivered to Mr 
Pakenham my Passport and an official Note referring to my Affairs, 
of which, as yet, I have no copy, but shall pnJcure one, together with 
the other Correspondence, for the information and Satisfaction of 
the President and the Department. The Secretary of State had re- 
solved to quit office the next day, and hence was willing and probably 
preferred to despatch my general Mission, in the way already stated, 
leaving the matter of the Armistice open and pending for his Suc- 
cessor. As it was Entirely useless, imder the circumstances, to press 
the Matter with Mr. Caiiedo, on the point of leaving office, Mr Paken- 
ham called on Grenl : Almonte, Secretary of War, and after some con- 
versation Mr. Almonte assured Mr Pakenham that he was in favor 
of an Armistice, and had, and would continue to, advocate it, and, if 
I would give them more time, he thought, something could be accom- 
plished. It was agreed that I would wait eight days^ provided Mr. 
Almonte would take the Matter up in earnest, and endeavour to carry 
it through. 

This then is the present position of Affairs; but I much doubt if 
any thing will grow out of it, as the Cabinet is falling to pieces 
gradually. A Mr Gutierrez Estrada, who was expected to suc- 
ceed Mr. Caiiedo, now declines, and the State Depart., will be turned 
over, ad interim, to the Minister of the Interior, Mr Marin who is a 
Jesuit and fanatic; and the only man who can do anything is Al- 
monte, and whether he can drag the President and Such Colleagues 
into his Views, even were he so disposed, is a Matter to my mind very 
doubtful.

satisfactory assurances of the fixed determination of the Mexican 
Government to listen tOy and act upon^ the friendly overtures of the 
Govmt. of Texas. 

The period named in the Agent's last Note having e^ired, with- 
out his having received any assurance whatever of the pacific Views 
of the Govmt. of Mexico towards Texas, or even of its disposition to 
entertain the subject in question, the Agent is compelled very reluc- 
tantly to adopt the Course which he proposed in his last named 
communication. 

The Agent on this occasion is impelled to express his deep regret 
that after so long a Stay in the City of Mexico, he is obliged to 
abandon his friendly Mission, (which has already occupied tkrice 
the period originally contemplated by the Governmt. of Texas) not 
only without having accomplished the pacific views and wishes of 
the President and Congress of Texas, for which the Agent was most 
fully authorized; but even without having been able to present 
officially, or formally^ the propositions which he was authorized and 
instructed to make, or to convey a single act or declaration which 
indicates that Mexico ever desires a good understanding, or peaceable 
relations with Texas, on any Terms. 

If the Agent retires disappointed at the fruitless result of all his 
efforts, how much More will the President of Texas and his consti- 
tutional advisers be Surprized to learn that after Nine Months ma- 
ture deliberation and reflection, the Govmt. of Mexico have refused 
to hear the proposals of Peace and Amity preferred by the Govern- 
ment of an Ex-Colony to the Mother Country, for its Consideration. 

The Agent, however, has digressed from the purpose, for which 
he craves the indulgent consideration of the Hon. the Secretary of 
State, inasmuch as the said Agent, having already and at length, 
Spread before the Governmt. and Congress of Mexico the objects 
and Views of the Governmt he has the honor to represent, it woidd 
be quite superfluous now to enlarge upon the Subject. 

The Agent takes it for granted that the Hon. the Secretary of 
State will have the goodness to furnish him, or, (if that be objection- 
able) the Hon Richard Pakenham, whose official and friendly inter- 
position and good offices have been resorted to and freely rendered 
during the whole negotiation, with an official Communication, which 
will refer to (in such terms as the Hon the Secretary of State may 
deem most appropriate) the origin, progress, and termination of the 
Mission of the Said Agent to the Governmt of the Republic of 
Mexico. 

The Agent begs leave to present to the Hon the Secretary of State 
his regard and consideration, and through H. E. to H. E. the Presi- 
dent of the Republic his highest and most profound respects.

Havana^ but the British Cabinet Courier has been detained day hy 
day Until now, in consequence of a misunderstanding between Mr 
Pakenham and this Government, which^ after several days doubtful 
efforts, has been finally settled in a manner entirely satisfactory to 
Mr P, and the Courier will leave in the morning. 

About the Middle of September, Mr. Pakenham presented to this 
Govmt. sundry matters and claims, some of which were of long stand- 
ing, for final adjustment and payment, and informed them that if 
by the 29th Septr they were not favourably disposed of, he should 
demand his passports. The* 29th came, and it was very generally 
believed that every thing wajs adjusted, or in Course of Settlement, 
which was more or less true, and thus matters run on, until the 1st. 
inst, when from Some Unexpected difficulty, Mr P required peremp- 
torily his Passports, and closed all intercourse on his part with the 
Govmt. and communication at the Palace. 

Until Yesterday, the whole time has been taken Up in endeavours 
on the part of the Government to reconcile, and arrange matters with 
Mr. P. who would not withdraw his demand for passports, nor Visit 
any of the Govmt. offices, or Public Departments, pending his un- 
satisfied demands ; but conferences were held, at the House of one of 
the Ministers, and matters finally have been satisfactorily arranged, 
so far as Mr Pakenham is concerned. 

I have not been informed of the Merits of the Question as yet^ but 
I am Satisfied that the Govemmt. were compelled to Meet all his 
(Mr P's) demands, or he would have insisted on his Passports, 

Of course this state of things has entirely Suspended, for the time 
being, all progress as regards my proposals for an Armistice and the 
Eight days, which have already elapsed, must be extended a few 
days longer, to endeavour to ascertain if anything can be reasonably 
anticipated from Mr Almontes promises. To morrow, after the de- 
parture of the Packet, Mr Pakenham has promised me his renewed 
and active co-operation, and I trust that in a few days I shall know 
the result. 

I have advised the Conmiissioners in London " both Via N. York, 
and by this Engl Packet direct of my position for their information 
and Government. 

I wrote Com. Moore, a few days since,^ informing him, that I 
thought I should soon know the final result, and that I might be 
down myself by the 10th. to the 15th inst. I shall write him again 
today, but I have not much confidence that either of them will reach 
him, and hence I have not sent to him despatches for your Depart- 
ment, but disposed of them through other channels.

712 AMERICAN HISTOMCAL ASSOCIATIOK. 

The Sad condition of the Country, the weakness of the Gvmt, and 
their insufficiency, the boldness and threatening Attitude of parties 
who seek for power, have increased to such a degree that Every thing 
seems to threaten a dissolution of the present order of things. 

A change through the medium of another revolutionaiy movem^it 
is dayly anticipated, the result of which will probably be a Dictator j 
proclaimed by the Army, or a State of Anarchy, which perhaps may 
be a stiU greater evU. 

The Country and Gvmt never was in So deplorable and critical a 
State as at the present moment, nor can I foresee what will be the issue 
of the present fermentation of so many discordant elements, for there 
has not been wanting a Man of high political Standing, who has been 
bold enough to advocate, under his own Signature, and in a laboured 
pamphlet, within the last few days, A return to a monarchy under A 
European Prince. 

Notwithstanding this distracted State of things, the Gvmt. have 
obtained from Congress authority to negotiate a loan of two Millions 
of Dollars, which will perhaps produce Nett 1. or 1^. Millions. 

Two thirds of this amt. is appropriated exclusively to the creation 
of a Navy, and other Expenses incidental to the Campaign against 
Texas. There is a Contract now being made by the Capitalists here 
for the Loan, and to furnish the Gvmt., by the 1st. of May next, with 
the following Vessels — viz. 
2 Steamers 

1 Corvette 

2 Brigs 

2 Schooners 

4 Gun Boats 
the estimated cost of which, and of keeping them in Active Service for 
8. Months^ is fixed at $1,300 fiOO. 

They will have a plausible Excuse for delaying the projected 
invasion of Texas, so much talked of here^ while waiting for their 
Flotilla; altho' a better reason now exists for not undertaking an 
expedition, Viz: the Employment which Canales and his troops are, 
at the present time, giving Arista, with all his forces. The former, by 
a Silent movement with Some 3. or 400 men, took possession of Victoria 
de Tamaulipas, Capital of that Depart., thus causing great alarm in 
compelling Arista to return from the frontier, where he was mardiing 
for the second tims, having returned on the first occasion on account 
of the Appearance of the Texian Corvette off the Brazos. The troops 
of Canales left Victoria, and Arista was satisfied with taking posses- 
sion of the Village, and, as usuxil^ issuing a flaming proclamation. 
It is very probable that both Canales and Arista will concentrate 
their forces, and while the strength of the tatter is nuTnericaUy much

the greatest, he has great respect for the Rifles^ of which it is said 
there are Some 3. or 400. in Canales' division. 

The foregoing is as near the position of things as can here be 
generally known, where the Gvmt. publish what Suits their con- 
venience, and private information, if not intercepted, is Suppressed, 
from apprehension of consequences. 

This brief and imperfect Sketch of the State of things here must 
Suffice until I reach either Galveston, or N. Orleans, where I hope 
to receive the wishes of the President, whether he desires to See me 
at the Capitol, where I shall be most happy to proceed, and make in 
person my final Report if, as I earnestly hope, the State of my health 
will permit. // not^ I shall not fail to advise the department immedi- 
ately.

I have been anxiously expecting to hear from you since yours of 
the 21st August, which communication I answered and also wrote 
you on the 17th. Sept : 

On the 3d inst: while at anchor imder the Island of Lobos (it 
blowing then a heavy gale from the North) I discovered a Mexican 
Brig on the Reef about four miles to the Nd of us, and after very 
great exertions succeeded in getting a Boat along side of her (but 
not until after she had been aground thirty-eight hours^ and rescu-

ing from a watery grave the Passengers and Crew amounting in all 
to twenty-six persons; who were made comfortable as they could be 
on board of this Vessel, and in eleven days were landed at Tampico 
(to which port they were bound) with all their Baggage. 

The Brig was the " Segunda Fama " from Vera Cruz loaded with 
Flour, Coffee and other articles. 
I refer you to the Tampico paper of the 17th. inst : 
On our arrival off Tampico Bar we were very short of water and 
as the River was very high, I was getting some outside of the Bar at 
least two miles from the Fort, when the Boat was fired into, three 
successive shots passing very near her; this circumstan<5e renders it 
necessary that I should inform you that agreeably to my instructions, 
I am fully authorized, in the event of a shot being fired at our Flag, 
to commence active hostilities, and if your negotiations are broken 
off in consequence, you will find a Vessel off Point Mariandrea to 
convey you to Texas, for fr(Mn this day any Mexican Vessel, that I 
fall in with, will be captured.

This Ship was at the time, at anchor under the lee of the Island, 
and the next day, as soon as the Brig was discovered, every effort was 
made to save the lives of those on board — one of the Boats of this 
Ship succeeded in getting alongside of her, but not until after she 
had been aground about thirty-eight hours, and it gives me pleasure 
to inform you that we did succeed in rescuing from a Watery grave 
every soul, twenty-six in number, who was on board, and also their 
Baggage. 

Captain Pablo Alcedan goes on shore in his own Boat (which has 
been repaired) manned by men from his own Vessel, for the purpose 
of procuring a Launch to take the Passengers, and every thing they 
have saved, together with his own property, on shore ; and I give you 
this my assurance, that any Laundi or other Vessel that you may be 
pleased to permit to come out for that purpose, will not be molested 
by this Vessel or any one on board of her. 

Captain Pablo Alcedan will give you a list of the passengers, and 
I refer you to him and every other person who was on board of the 
Brig, as to the mode of treatment which your Countrymen whose mis- 
fortune it was to be shipwrecked, and thus to fall into our hands, have 
received from us, contenting myself by assuring you that they have 
had since they have been on board of this Vessel every comfort which 
it was in our power to give them.

Sir, 

In despatch No. 59 accompaning this, I have alluded to a letter 
received from an old acquaintance of mine in Mexico (a copy of 
which I also enclose herewith) and have promised a history of this 
person on a separate sheet,*' to be kept apart, (as well as the copy of 
this letter *) for private information. 

The writer, Juan N Leplicher, is a Frenchman of talent, and edu- 
cation, who was employed by Greo. Antionio Nixon and Archibald 
Hotchkiss, the former CommisV and the latter Empresario for the 
Grants of Vehlein Zavala and Burnet, at Nacogdoches in 1833 for 
about one year and a half. With these persons he quarreled vio- 
lently, as well as with many other prominent individuals of Nacog- 
doches — at one time was attacked by a crowd, and but for the timely 
assistance of one or two brave men, might have perished He is of 
a very irrascible temper, and bitterly hated many Texans, for wrongs 
(he had as he conceived) received, openly avowing his hatred, and 
finally in 1835 leaving the country. I thought him a man of honor,

and still do, (but his enemies blinded as I think by their hostility 
against him) profess to beleive him guilty of all manner of crime. 
Of his intimacy with Almonte the present Sec'y of War, I am satis- 
fied, as that commenced during his stay in Texas at Nacogdoches — 
and his account of the influence he posesses with other leaders, I im- 
plicitly believe — of his industry, indefatigability, and talent I have 
had ample proof, as well as of his perfect knowledge of the Spanish 
language. My interest in a person who was perhaps unfriendly to 
Texas, at least to many Texans, proceeded from the Conviction that 
he was a man of honor, which I still cherish. 

Reposing however a Governmental trust, of the nature of the one 
solicited, is a delicate matter.; and I think it incimibent in giving 
my own opinion, to state that of others essentially differing. Of my 
Judgment you will form your own estijnate, and of the propriety of 
employing this person in any way, you can decide, but in case his 
offices may be required, with a promise of remuneration only in case 
of success. I should desire to have the proposition sent through me, 
in order to bind him more closely to a faithful discharge [of his 
duty], by a solemn pledge to me personally — who have always be- 
friended him, and I flatter myself [that I] am justified in expecting 
perfect confidence and frankness on his part. 

I shall of course be much gratified to contribute to the attainment 
of so important an end as the Pacification with Mexico. Awaiting 
any suggestion you may do me the honor to submit — 
I am most respectfully Yours etc

Dear Friend, 

I heard some time ago that you were at the capital of the U States 
in an official capacity and from that moment had proposed to write 
by the first opportunity, but having nothing of interest to communi- 
cate I had defered doing so. The departure of Mr Treat and the 
failure in the object which had brought him here, have induced me 
to address you and propose my services for the negotiations of the 
same business. Your acquaintance with my principles I doubt not 
will ensure your fo warding my views. I was opposed to the Tex-

to assist them in obtaining their independence. My acquaintance is 
extensive with the influential men of both parties here, and if I am 
instructed to act I may avail myself of a favorable opportunity to 
obtain a recognition, but let the instructions be clear, the proposal 
fair, and explicit, without any equivocation, because the thing can- 
not be discussed, it is too obnoxious to the mass of the people. It 
should be done by one capable of persuading the Government (either 
the present « invested with extraordinary powers, or the next if it is 
the federal) to take the step, a bold one indeed, and then the opposi- 
tion bribe into silence, but bribery is the last thing to be resorted to, 
and not the first as was done. 

If S.* should ever govern, I can rely upon the assistance of his 
Premier who seems not averse to the Idea of a Recognition but 
recommends utter silence on the subject, not to awaken the opposi- 
tion. Should the Federals be successful the leading man is intimate 
with me and through him, I have always been informed of all their 
plans; and in the ranks of the present Government, I have one or two 
men who would serve your cause, although they have the name of 
being your enemies. Let me hear from you whether my offer be ac- 
cepted or not. This business must have no influence on our former 
friendship. Your letters must be directed to me here and not to a 
Commercial House, and let your style be so ambiguous as not to 
awaken suspicion. 

Excuse my scribling, for I am quite out of practice, and am for- 
getting my English fast. 

Farwell ; and believe me dear friend, affectionately yours.

dieted, but owing to tlie many impediments encomitered by the 
revolters, I was ashamed that I had written so much upon the sub- 
ject, lest it should entirely fall through. The object of my Mission 
to this coimtry being to remit to the Government truths and not 
unfounded surmises. . 

I informed the Colonel and the Government of Texas that it was 
useless to dally with this Government relative to the Recognition of 
the former. It is true I once thought that a favorable turn was about 
to take place, and mentioned it in some one of my letters, but my hopes 
were soon blasted and I gave it as my opinion that all efforts would 
be fruitless. This opinion I also gave Mr Treat, but he was willing 
to believe the contrary. The blow on Wednesday was given, the 
Ultimatum, the final answer df Mexico and that was, " we will have 
nothing to do, or say directly or indirectly relative to the Recogni- 
tion of Texas." Mr. Treat will leave in a few days for Vera Cruz 
and pass thence to Galveston or New Orleans. Let those interested 
be acquainted with the hostile feelings of the people of this country 
towards Texas. 

The Government of Mexico has affected a loan of six Millions of 
Dollars, out of which they get one and a half Millions cash, this 
Million and a half to be appropriated forthwith for the purchase of 
a fleet and carraying on a war against Texas. Be on the alert if 
your intentions are to fight on the offensive. Mexico will never be 
weaker than she is now, owing to her internal disputes. If you 
procrastinate, you will have to encounter a much greater force on 
Land than Mexico can now raise but a fleet into the bargain. I am 
persuaded that Mexico will invade Texas if she is not prevented, 
and if she is only prevented by a defensive arm she will always keep 
Texas in a state of agitation. The State of Mechoacan now Guada- 
lajara is nearly in the power of the Federals. The capital of said 
State Vallidolid, is besieged perhaps taken by this time. Gusman 
is the Chief of the Revolters has the mountains for his home and is 
considered a Robber having to live by depredations 

New Mexico I believe is nearly lost, Tobasco has been retaken by 
Anayft. Some 400 men friends of Canales made an extraordinary 
march upon a town called Victoria and defeating a Col. of Arista 
with 300 citizens and Government troops. Arista himself has been 
dodging about Matamoras with some 2000 under his command and 
I am enclined to believe he feels uneasy. The Government I believe 
count some 3500 men with hopes of a reinforcement Gen Bravo is 
expected here in a few days, and I learn by a letter of his to a friend 
which I obtained a view of, he is to take the Presidential Chair, while 
Bustamente with the troops of this city in all 3000 and those on Rio 
Grande marches into Texas. This is generally believed to be the 
movement [on which] 400 went off the other morning, but with all

my vigilance I cannot find out their destination. The federals of 
this city are still holding meetings, and have made attempts to rise, 
but were discovered and their plans flustrated. They have lost their 
day here not in spirit but in power. You are aware that the move- 
ments of the country are slow and you have always time. I shall re- 
main here only a few days longer, and then set out for the Rio Grande 
Country in order to be in the centre of news, as the enemy will be cut- 
ting pranks in that quarter and by being among them I shall be en- 
abled from time to time to give information of their proceedings. 
You will in the meantime please continue to direct to Vera Cruz, as 
I shall inform the house * where to send your letters for me. 

Please give me any information of a prevalent nature, and request 
Col Bee to give such Items as he may think proper and useful, as I 
shall be able to pass through their very camp, having made friends 
with several of the officers. 

My best respects for the Col. and receive my best wishes for your 
health and prosperity. 



ViTALBA TO Lamar. 

Galveston 8th. December I84O. 
Sir, 

By the unexpected and lamented death of my companion Mr. Treat, 
your private and confidential Agent near the Government of Mexico^ 
which happened the 30th. of last month, on board the Schooner of 
War San Antonio on our passage to this Port, it has become my duty 
not only to inform Your Excellency of the Sad occurrence, but also 
to acquaint you with the last correspondence he had during his stay 
in Vera Cruz ; copies of which I now have the honor of forwarding 
to you, certified by Mr. J. W. Moore, purser of said Schooner, in order 
that you may be put in possession as quick as possible of all the docu- 
ments relating to his mission. 

It was my intention on my arrival here to have set out immediately 
for the Capital, but the State of my health which before was d^icate, 
has been sensibly affected by the decease of my friend, which I wit- 
nessed, so that I have been compelled to abandon the idea for the 
present; and this delay while it tends to my recovery, will allow me 
time to receive here your answer, as also to await your commands, 
should you deem it expedient for me to present myself therej in order 
to explain to you verbally every thing relative to Mr. Treats official 
business; with all which I am intimately acquainted, as of course 
Your Excellency must be aware.

I need hardly mention the propriety of keeping Secret the Agency 
I have had in these aflfairs, because, should Your Excellency con- 
sider my feeble efforts of any utility hereafter, they will probably 
in that manner be more effectually employed. 

Having nothing more of importance to communicate for the 
present, it only remains for me to condole with your Excellency for 
the loss of a citizen so interested in the prosperity of the growing 
Republic, and who with so much ardour, as well as with the Sacrifice 
of his existence made every possible exertion to obtain the acknowl-

I have the honor to be,

the Government of Mexico and that of Texas, have proved of no 
avail ; as you Sir, are fully aware, I cannot permit myself to leave 
the Capital, without expressing to you, how much the President and 
People of Texas are indebted for your prompt, kind and friendly 
interposition, in behalf of the pacific objects involved in my mission 
to this Government, and to assure you that your efforts and exertions 
to induce this Government to listen to the friendly overtures prepared 
for their consideration, are duly appreciated and will long be held 
in grateful remembrance by a Government and people, whose intel- 
ligence and philanthropy induced them to seek a peace even at a 
great sacrifice; but this being once, deliberately rejected^ and with 
disdain, by the Mother Coimtry, it remains now for the Chivalry of 
Texas to respond to Mexico, whenever the interests and honor of 
the Country require a resort to arms. 

For myself individually^ I cannot find language to express my obli- 
gations for your kind attentions and the personal considerations, with 
which, I have been so uniformly received and treated. 

In closing my Conununication, I beg leave to present to you, my 
best wishes, for your continued health and happiness, through life.

ing the memorandum which you put into my hands on the day pre-

724 AMERICAN HISTORICAL, ASSOCIATION. 

The Passport issued in conformity with your request accompanied 
Senor Caiiedo's note; but you will perceive that he declines to enter 
into the explanation solicited by you respecting the transactions con- 
nected with your Mission, the fruitless issue of which he attributes 
to your not having confined your propositions to the basis originally 
put forth by this Government, viz : " That Mexico would not consent 
to relinquish the sovereignty of the Territory of Texas.'' 

It is true that in Seiior Canedo's letter of the 11th. Deer. 1839, a 
copy of which I transmitted at the time to Gen. Hamilton, and of 
the contents of which you are also informed, the ncm-alienation of 
sovereignty was stated to be an indispensable condition to any ar- 
rangement ; but it is no less true that the introductory propositions, 
presented by you on the 23rd. March last, went directly to solicit the 
recognition of the independence of Texas, with such boundaries as 
might hereafter be agreed upon — that this proposition, so far from 
having been at once rejected by the Mexican Government as inad- 
missible, was referred to the Council of State, where the whole ques- 
tion with regard to Texas was made the subject of more than one 
anxious discussion — and finally that in conformity with the resolu- 
tion of the Council the correspondence which had passed between 
Seiior Caiiedo and myself, relative to your Mission and the propo- 
sitions presented by you, were submitted to the consideration of the 
Congress, where, however, the matter appears to have remained 
altogether unnoticed. 

It is therefore certain that the propositions submitted by you, 
although not confined to the basis originally annoimced by Senor 
Canedo, were to all intents and purposes entertained by the Executive 
branch of the Government, and not, as Senor Canedo would wish to 
have it inferred, rejected in limine because they went beyond the basis 
at first propounded by the Mexican Government. 

The above explanation will, I trust, serve in some degree to answer 
the purpose of the official communication which you wished to obtain 
from Senor Canedo : but I think it necessary to observe to you that, 
as my intercourse with the Government relative to your Mission has 
been all along of a confidential chjiracter, I should not feel at liberty 
to furnish you with the present statement, differing, as it does, in 
some respects from that conveyed by Senor Canedo's note, except 
for your private satisfaction, and with the understanding that it is 
not to be made use of in any manner likely to occasion inconvenience 
to the Government of Mexico. 

I sincerely deplore the unsuccessful result of a mission which has 
been conducted with so much zeal and discretion, and with such re- 
markable patience and perseverance on your part. 

It may be hoped that at some future, and perhaps not distant period 
a state of things will prevail in this Country more favourable to the

accomplishment of the object which every well wisher to Mexico and

leave to assure you of my continued readiness to attend to any com- 
munications which the authorities of Texas may be pleased to address 
to me with relation to that object, and of my earnest desire to be able 
to contribute to the establishment of a friendly understanding between 
the two Countries.

Mexico U October ISJ^O 
Deab Sib, 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your most obliging letter of 
the 10th. Inst, wherein you are so good as to express your sense of my 
exertions in favor of the pacifick objects of the Mission on which you 
have been employed in this Country. 

Much as I regret the failure of our joint labours to bring about a 
friendly understanding between Texas and Mexico, I request you to 
be assured that I shall at all times retain an agreeable recollection of 
our intercourse while engaged in the prosecution of that object, — and 
altho' you cannot but view with a still greater degree of disappoint- 
ment the result of which has attended so many mcHiths of anxious and 
persevering exertion on your part, allow me to record my humble 
opinion that every thing that zeal and ability could suggest as likely 
to lead to a favourable issue has been done by you in the execution of 
your Commission, and accordingly that you may enjoy the satisfac- 
tion of reflecting that if you have not succeeded it has been because 
success, under existing circumstances, was impossible. 

With great esteem and regard, and with best wishes for your health 
and happiness, 
I remain. 

My dear Sir, 

Yours faithfully, 

Sigd. R Pakenham,

Mexico 15 October ISJft 
Sir, 

I regret to have to acquaint you that upon communicating with 
the Mexican Government upon the subject of an Armistice an ar- 
rangement to which you considered yourself authorized by your 
Instructions to Subscribe; on the part of the authorities of Texas, 
I see no prospects of their agreeing to a transaction of that kind 
upon terms approaching to those which you would be willing to 
accede to. 

The Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me yesterday, 
that this Government can entertain no proposals for an Armistice 
which shall not be presented with the previous sanction of the Texian 
authorities; and that, in no case, can they consent to a provisional 
line of demarcation to the Southard, or on this side, of the River of 
San Antonio.

I have therefore reluctantly come to the opinion that, under pres-

Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 
the 14th. Inst:, by which, in fulj&lment of the instructions under 
which you act, you are so good as to make known to me " that should 
" the Government of Texas be constrained to change its position, and 
" commence offensive operations, it will not be with a view to extend- 
"ing its Territory beyond the Rio Grande, and any occupation or 
" Military Movement west of that River will be temporary, and solely 
" with the view of forcing the enemy to make peace." 

I will take the earliest opportunity to communicate this declara- 
tion to Her Majesty's Government, who, I doubt not will fully appre- 
ciate the sentiments by which it has been dictated. 
I have the honor to be with great resgard.

My DEAR Sir, 

I was much vexed by the disappointment which occurred about 
your escort. I hope you will have reached your journey's end with- 
out a repetition of the same annoyances. 

The enclosed Desps. arrived by the Post of Monday last. I might 
have sent them by the Post of the day before yesterday, to j&nd you 
at Jalapa, but I thought there might be some risk of your not receiv* 
ing them, and accordingly determined to consign them direct to Vera 
Cruz. 

I have written to Mr. Giffard in the sense we agreed upoil, and I 
inclose a letter of introduction to Captain Frazer of H. M's. Ship

" Sappho " in case you should require his assistance, in effecting your 
embarcation. 

There is no news here worth repeating to you, — ^but I was exceed- 
ingly glad to hear, the other day, from Dr. Jeeker, that he is quite 
satisfied about the state of your lungs. In fact he says that as far as 
your lungs are concerned you may live a thousand years. I mention 
this because, altho' he may have said the same to you, patients some- 
times do not place as much confidence in what Doctor's say to them 
about their case, as in what they say to a third party. I have no 
doubt that you will have found great benefit to your general health 
by the change to a Milder Climate. 

Do not forget your promise to write to me frcwn time to time, and 
above all things recollect that I consider my Commission still open 
to be the medium of conveying any fresh pacific overtures which it 
may be thought advisable to make to the Mexican Govt. 

My firm conviction is that you wd. gain nothing by attacking or 
insulting the Mexicans, but on the contrary bi^^ng down great mischief 
upon yourselves. You may be quite sure that if you do not molest 
chem it will be a long time before they think of attacking you, and 
meanwhile you will be acquiring strength instead of wasting it, as 
would be the case if you brought about a state of active hostilities. 

This conviction induced me to write to Genl. Hamilton in Dec." 
last to the following effect 

" I admit that the present condition of Mexico is not the most fav- 
*'ourable for the recommencement of offensive operations against 
"Texas, upon a scale likely to lead to important results, but I am 
" also strongly of opinion that an attack upon any part of the Na- 
" tional Territory by a Foreign force would not fail to rouse the latent 
" energies of the Country and induce the Mexicans to submit to ex- 
" traordinary sacrifices in undertaking measures of retaliation, and 
" thus give rise to a state of things far more likely to retard than to 
" accellerate the establishment of friendly relations between the two 
" Countries." 

This advice I now repeat to you as the friend and well-wisher of 
Texas, and if you should incline to the same opinion I trust that you 
will be able to make it prevail in the proper quarter. 

Goodbye, my dear Sir, Believe me, with best wishes, 
Yours always 

Very Sincerely 

(Sigd.) R Pakenham

which I have endeavoured to get to you, or some one of your vessels, 

by every effort and precaution in ray power to make from this place. 

Whether I shall succeed or not remains to be seen. If you get it 

at aU^ it will probably be to day. 

I send this down to Vera Cruz to avail of any oppty. that may 
present itself to send out to You, for I have been disappointed in 
using for this purpose the English Packet^ as I expected I should be 
able to do when I last wrote you. 

The Packet was to have sailed from Vera Cruz this day, but has 
been postponed until the 9th. inst, in consequence of a misunderstand- 
ing between Mr. Pakenham and this Govmt. Mr. P. being compelled 
to demand his passports, and after several days detention of the 
Packers Courier^ and negotiation, the matter has been settled to the 
satisfaction of Mr. Pakenham. 

This giuxsi blow up with Mr. P. has cost me a week^s lost tims^ but 
I begin again to morrow and shall know in a very few days how the 
Land lies^ and if, as I anticipate, nothing be done, I shall leave in- 
stanter for the Coast and endeavour to find you, or one of your Ves- 
sels, if at hand Without any thing further of interest at present,

Your two favours of 25th. Augt. and l7th. Sept. were placed in my 
hands on the 20th inst. having come up by the British Cabinet Cou- 
rier \ their contents have been duly examined, and I am much inddbted

one of your Vessels, to receive further communications from me. 1 
am also much gratified that you found it convenient to despatch thus 
promptly the San Jacinto with my conmiunications to Govmt. Should 
she return and rejoin you, I trust we shall both receive fresh advices

from Govmt. which, to me^ will be very gratifying, as my latest dates 
are 15th. June.* 

I notice the assurances you give me that no Molestation had been 
offered to any Mexican Vessel or property by the Squadron, which I 
have no doubt are entirely correct. But the Govmt. here have in- 
formation of several cases of annoyance, which they affect to believe, 
or perhaps really think correct, as they are in two instances backed 
by declarations made by the sufferers before the Captain of the port 
of Vera Cruz. I will state these cases, as I feel satisfied you can dis- 
prove them. 

The Vessel called Amalia^ Cap. Tomas Nardis^ sailed frcnn Tuxpain 
on the 8th. Augt. and arrived at Va. Cruz on the 11th. This Captain 
declares that on the 9th. or 10th. of same month he saw a Schooner 
at anchor near the shore, about 8 leagues to the Northward of Va. 
Cruz; that on seeing her (the Mexican) the said Schooner got under- 
way and chased under Mexican flag; on coming up, the flag was 
changed for the Texan, the Mexican boarded, and from her taken 
some 200 or 300 lbs. of brown sugar, a demijohn of Brandy, and some 
vegetables, and that asking if they had any money on board tho 
Schooner left them. The Schooner Idelo was chased at the same 
time, but not boarded. 

A recent account which has been sent up to Govmt. states that 
one of of the Texan Vessels took from a fisherman all his flsh^ and 
gave him as compensation a fii^e Dollar Treasury Note of Texas^ 
which has been sent up to Govmt. Another statement is that your 
crews have landed on the coast several times and taken off cattle 
witluxnt compensation. 

Of course there are many other rumours not worth repeating, but 
those above named seem to be credited by the Govmt. and the two first 
stated being o-fficial^ they have a right to assume, that they are true, 
until disproven. 

I mention these matters more for your own information or govmt. 
than because they are of any importance to me here, as I am situated 
now, but if I had a statement disproving or denying these facts from 
an oHHcial or responsible source^ I should certainly lay it before the 
Government. 

I notice that you will continue to keep a Vessel at the place named, 
to receive my communications, which will be a great convenience in 
every way. I also notice what you say about using the waters of 
Mexico for your Vessels, and concur with you in your remarks, under 
existing circumstances. 

I have not written you until now, as no oppty. has presented to 
send out my letter, and because I have been expecting my mission 
would terminate promptly^ ever since the date of my last. The Govmt

have now refused en toto the conditions I had so long since placed 
before them for Peace and Recognition; and I am now discussing 
with them the project of an Armistice^ and have agreed to wait one 
week for the result. I have but very little expectation that we shall 
agree on anything; but I will apprize you of the result the moment 
the parties come to a conclusion. 

I have insisted on my Passport, and it has been granted this day, 
notwithstanding the question of Armistice is pending, and I have 
agreed to wait a week for the result. 

The Secretary of State will resign in a day or two, but whether 
his place will be filled ad interim by one of the other Secretaries, or 
a permanent appointment be made, I cannot say. 

I shall lose no time in reaching Va. Cruz as soon as I close up 
here, and without delay join your ship, or the Schooner, at the 
place appointed, if there; if not, shall make the best of my way to 
N. Orleans, by Havana, or the shortest route within my reach. 

I send this down to Va. Cruz, to go out to you by the Am. Packet 
Ann Louise. If an arrangement can he made^ and if you receive it, 
look out for the English Packet, to sail from Vera Cruz the same^ 
or the next day^ where you may, and probably will find another 
communication from me, and perhaps despatches for Govt. If any 
opportunity offers, send a copy of this to Govt., as its contents will 
be of interest, and may reach them before my own despatches. 
I remain Very respectfully and cordially.

Honourable and Respeci-ed Sir 

I have the honor of informing you that I have just arrived from 
the Pacific by way of the City of Mexico, in which Republic I have 
been Remaining for the last two years in order to gather every in- 
formation of our common enemy (Mexico) Relative to the good or 
evil of Texas. 

From time to time I Remitted to Texas and to Col Bee, of what I 
knew. At present Mexico is very low in the mouth. Though she

has realized one million five hundred thousand dollars out of the 
Late five million Loan, they will be unable to accomplish nothing 
though ever so willing. You have no doubt some knowledge of the 
manner that the Mexicans manuver. Those Gentlemen at the Heads 
of departments make a great hugh and Cry when Low in pocket, that 
money and an army must be Raised to go against Texas. But so soon 
as they have this money secured, they hush up apply the money to 
other purposes, generaly to the agrandizement of themselves or party. 
So I expect it will be with the present Loan obtained. When I Left 
Mexico nothing was said of an expedition to Texas. Nothing said 
Relative to their Fleet. In Guadalajara I found nothing doing, in 
Guanajato, Queretero, St. Luis Potosi Durango and Zacatexas. Do.« 
General Arista was pursueing some 300 Camanches who had pene- 
trated far down into the Country laying waste every thing in their 
way, having taken many Mexican woman and children prisoners And 
having killed several hundred Mexicans. 

The despatches from the San Bernard had not reached Mexico, 
[but] had I think Reached Vera Cruz. Mexico I think will not Rec- 
ognise Texas to the very last extreme. I am afraid she will be too 
proud. Some fears must always be kept up by the Texians on the 
frontiers, as they May Like the Camanches some day do mischief on 
the settlements. Texas must Never sleep, must never believe a 
Smoth and fair tale, be always on the Alert, And teach the Mexicans 
to fear for they Can't love nor be true. 

Although I have made these Last Remarks, I would not be under- 
stood that the Mexicans were at present Like to commit hostilities 
on the outposts, in strowling parties, but that it must be the duty of 
the Texian Government to provide against such hostilities, which I 
think will likely take place if not soon, at some later period. 
I am Dear Sir with much Respect

to hand you herewith your Commission and Credentials as such, and 
to inform you, that you will find prepared for you at Galveston, under 
instructions from the Secretary of War and Navy, one of the Public 
Armed Vessels, to take you and your suite to Vera Cruz, or sudi other 
port on the Coast of Mexico, as you may select for your debarkation. 

By a Convention entered into between Lord Palmerston and Gen. 
Hamilton on the 14th day of Novr. last, (a certified copy of which, 
with its ratification is furnished you,) you will perceive that her 
Brittannic Majesty's Government has offered its interposition and 
Mediation in the settlement of the differences existing between this 
Country and Mexico, and the primary object of your Mission is to 
open and conduct such negotiations under the auspicious influences 
of that Mediation as it is hoped, will lead to the establishment of a 
permanent peace. You will therefore advise freely with the Hon. 
Mr Packenham Her Britannic Majestys Minister at Mexico, as to 
the preliminary measures, you may find it necessary to adopt, and 
after consultation, pursue such plans, as may appear most advisable 
for the attainment of the objects you have in view, not departing 
from the spirit of your general instructions. 

Upon your reaching the Mexican Coast, you will make known to 
the Commandant of the place, at which you shall seek to land, through 
such channel, as you find most convenient, the objects of your mission, 
and if you are not immediately furnished by him with the necessary 
safe conducts and passports for the city of Mexico, you will adopt 
such measures as you may deem most advisable for communicating 
with Mr Packenham with the view of ascertaining through him, 
whether or not you will be received and accredited as the agent of 
this Government for the Purpose of entering into negotiations con- 
templated by the convention to which I have ref er'd you ; and in the 
mean time, you will remain in Port, if permitted to do so untill you 
receive answers to your despatches Otherwise you will proceed to 
some more friendly port where you will remain untill such time as 
you may expect replies from Mr Packenham 

The Vessel which will take you down will be entirely under your 
Control and direction as regards her movements untill you shall have 
finally discharged her from this service. You will therefore at all 
times freely give such instructions to the Officer who will be in Com- 
mand of her, as you may deem best for your purposes and under such 
instructions he will take you from place to place as circumstances 
may require. 

Should negotiations be opened with the Authorities of Mexico, 
you will consider the letter addressed by the Department to the Hon. 
Barnard. E. Bee, under date of February 20th 1839 as the basis of 
the instructions under which you will conduct those negotiations, ex-

cept SO far as the same is Modified by the Convention with England 
and by specific points of instructicm hereinafter contained. 

It has suggested itself to the President that in your discussi(»is 
respecting boundary, embarrassments may arise which will be diffi- 
cult to adjust growing out of the locality of the harbor known as the 
Brasos Santiago and its importance to the Rio Grande, as being the 
only convenient shipping port for the conmierce of that River. This 
harbour is entirely within the limits of Texas, as defined by the act 
of Congress of 19th Dec 1836, and as nothing less than those limits 
can be accepted for our boundary, you may find this, the most diffi- 
cult point of adjustment which will be presented in your negotiations. 
It is certainly not to be expected that Mexico will willin^y yield the 
entire control of a port, so essential to the existence of aU oMnmer- 
cial advantages which she may expect to derive from the Navigation 
of the Rio Grande, and this consideration may prevent their con- 
ceding to us that River, as the proper boundary between the two coun- 
tries, when no other would be deemed of sufficient importance to be 
pertinaciously insisted upon. It is certainly desirable that we should 
possess the entire and exclusive Control over all the harbours and 
waters within our acknowledged limits and it is expected that you 
will urge the right to the exercise of such exclusive Control over the 
harbor of the Brasos Santiago so long as you can do so, without 
jeopardizing your whole negotiations. This however must be avoided 
if it can be done by a reasonable and fair comprcnnise of the question, 
for the establishment of Peace with Mexico is at this time a matter 
of too much importance to the Prosperity of Texas, to permit us to 
insist upon points, which would defeat it, when those points do not 
involve the honour or integrity of the Nation, or the yielding of any 
essential right. I am therefore instructed by the President to say to 
you, that should Mexico claim the right to the free use of the Brasos 
Santiago as a Sine qua non to a treaty of peace and recc^nition, you 
are at liberty to concede it, so far as to stipulate that she shall have 
the free right to enter it with her vessels and commerce at all times 
and as freely depart from it, without being subject to any of the rules 
or restrictions which may be adopted by this Government for the reg- 
ulation of its own commerce and that she shall also be entitled to scnnc 
convenient position upon it, as a place for deposite for her Merchan- 
dises and produce, and to a free transit across the land for such Mer- 
chandises and produce to the 'most convenient point for shipment 
upon the Rio Grande : and that these priviledges shall be continued to 
her as long as the country bordering on the Western Bank of the 
River shall remain under the Control of and belong to her Govern- 
ment, but should that Country either by treaty with a foreign power, 
or by other means pass into the hands [of another nation] and be no 
longer under the Control of her authorities, such stipulaticm is to

cease, and all future regulations upon the subject will be considered 
as open to negotiation with the power that may then clakn the joint 
right with Texas to Navigate the River. As the continuance of unin- 
terrupted harmony between the two Countries will be of vast impor- 
tance to both, should their present difficulties be adjusted, you may 
for the purpose of shewing our desire to promote it, stipulate that this 
Government will hereafter by the rigid enforcement of its laws, pre- 
vent as far as possible all encroachments by its citizens upon the 
Mexican Territory, and all interference on their part in her domestic 
affairs, or in any internal difficulties which may arise between the 
Mexican States or any of the citizens thereof. 

It is not considered necessary in this communication to advert in 
detail to the various points which should be embraced in a treaty, 
either of peace and recognition, or of Commerce with Mexico. You 
are intimately acquainted with the condition of the Coimtry and what 
is essential to its prosperity, and the President relying upon your 
judgment and discretion in conducting the negotiation, most cheer- 
fully confides to you its details under the fullest assurance that the 
honor interests and character of Texas will be maintained by you, and 
will be safely preserved in your hands. 

If after the commencement of your negotiations, you shall find a 
disposition manifested by those with whom you are treating to pro- 
tract them for the purposes of delay, without exhibiting a serious 
inclinacion for adjustment, you will at any moment be at liberty to 
bring them to a close and return home and will not be required to 
wait for special permission to do so from this Department. This 
however must be left entirely to the exercise of a sound discretion, 
which while it will dictate the propriety of putting an end to useless 
and unmeaning discussions that can result in no benefit will equally 
suggest to you the impropriety of urging with intemperate haste and 
pertinacity matters, which you deem essential, and which you may by 
mildness and forbearance ultimately succeed in attaining. 

If you are not permitted to open negotiations with the Government 
of Mexico, or having opened them, should find it necessary to dis- 
continue them, without any beneficial results, you will after notify- 
ing this Government of the fact be at liberty, to return by the way of 
Yucatan and ascertain what part the Government of that country 
would be willing to take in a war which Texas might be compelled to 
wage against Mexico. In doing this however it is only expected that 
you will sound the people of Yucatan on the subject as you are not 
furnished with authority to enter into any treaty stipulations, but 
you may suggest to the authorities the propriety of their sending an 
agent to this Government with full powers to treat and you may 
give them assurances of our friendship and willingness to receive 
such an agent. In conducting negotiations of so much delicacy and

importance as those with which you are charged to the Government 
of Mexico, to a final and satisfactory conclusion, the President is 
aware that a control of funds beyond what is allowed for your salary 
and outfit may be essential td you. He has therefore given me in- 
structions to furnish you with Authority to draw either directly upon 
this Government, or through our loan Commissioners, for any sum 
not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, which you may deem necessary, 
but it is expected that this right to draw for funds will not be exor- 
cised except you find it absolutely essential to your success. 

In this however, as in most other things connected with your Mis- 
sion, your own discretion must be the guide for your Conduct, as your 
well known character for honor and probity is with him a sufficient 
guarrantee that his confidence in its exercise will not have been mis- 
placed. 

Wishing you full success in the accomplishment of the Arduous 
duties you have undertaken and a safe return to your Coimtry and 
friends, 

I have the honor to remain

This expedition has been organized by the President for the pur- 
pose of opening a communication with that portion of the Republic 
known as Santa f6, and of closely uniting it with the rest of the 
Republic, so that the Supremacy of our constitution and laws may 
be asserted equally over the entire tract of country embraced within 
our limits; but as that portion is inhabited by a people strangers to 
our institutions and to our system of Government, speaking a differ- 
ent language, and deriving their origin from an alien source, whose 
religion, laws, manners and customs, all differ so widely from our 
own, the greatest circumspection will be necessary, in making known 
to that people the object of your mission, on your first arrival at 
Santa f^ and subsequently in conducting your intercourse with them. 

The great object of the President is to attach the people of the 
District of Santa H to our system of Government, to create in their 
minds a reverence for our Constitution, and to spread among them, 
a spirit of Liberty and independence, which will alone qualify them 
for good citizens, under a Government, the very existence of which, 
depends upon the will of the people. 

To this end you cannot exercise too much caution in the conduct, 
conversation, and general deportment, not only of yourselves, but of 
the military command which accompanies you. That you will 
meet with narrow prejudices in the minds of some, and stubborn 
opposition from others, is not unlikely. It is even to be expected. 
But it is believed that patience and forbearance on the part of the 
commissioners, and an uniform gentleness of behaviour, will con- 
ciliate at first their good will, and afterwards secure their confidence 
and esteem, more effectually than any other mode that could be 
adopted. Upon this head of your instructions, much more might be 
said; but from the complete knowledge which you possess of the 
views of the President, and from the very great confidence which 
he reposes in your wisdom and discretion, it is deemed unnecessary. 

Upon entering the city of Santa fe, your first object will be, to 
endeavour to get into your hands all the public property. You will 
in all probability find this the most delicate and difficult of all your 
duties, to perform. Should those intrusted with the care of public 
Tiroperty, hesitate or refuse to comply with your demand of posses- 
sion, you will try all gentle means before resorting to force. Per- 
suasion and argument are sometimes as powerful as the sword, and 
it becomes us to avoid, if possible, the shedding of blood. The 
People of Santa fe are our fellow citizens; and it cannot be long be- 
fore they will be fully incorporated with us, partaking of all the 
advantages and benefits which we enjoy, under our form of govern- 
ment. Thus there is a double motive presented for persuasive and 
conciliatory measures. If they can be brought with their own free

will and consent, to submit quietly and cheerfully to an incorpora- 
tion with us, acknowledging themselves a constituent portion of the 
Republic, and setting into operation our constitution and laws, then 
may we confidently expect of them, fidelity and patriotism; but if 
they are awed into submission by threats, or still worse if they are 
driven to it by the application of Military power, the disasterous con- 
sequences that must inevitably follow, cannot well be foreseen. Too 
much care therefore, cannot be used in this first step. The mode of 
effecting this portion of your duty, must of necessity be left mainly 
with yourselves. Difficulties and emergencies will arise which can- 
not be anticipated, and upon which therefore, no specific instructions 
can be given. Some of the arguments however, which you will urge 
upon their consideration are these. First — You will assure them of 
the protection of the Government in the enjoyment of life, Liberty, 
and property, of the trial by Jury, of their entire freedom from all 
forced loans, and from all taxes levied without their consent^ of the 
liberty of speech and press, of religious toleration, and in short of 
all the political privileges contained in the Bill of Rights and consti- 
tution. On the other hand you will place before their eyes, the folly 
of offering resistance when it cannot possibly avail them. Contrast 
Mexico — feeble, distracted, and continually torn by civil wars and 
Revolutionary movements — ^with a load of debt, and no means of 
paying — with the advantages enjoyed by Texas. Tell them of the 
great increase in our population since the Revolution. Show them 
the limits of the country upon the map, and tell them with these 
limits published to the world, we have obtained the acknowledge- 
ment of our Independence by the United States, England, France, 
Belgium and Holland, and assure them of the unalterable determina- 
tion of this Government to assert and maintain its Jurisdiction over 
every inch of its soil, and of its ability too, to carry its resolve into 
execution. In making known this determination of the Government, 
you should be particularly careful, not to rouse the jealous pride of 
the people ; and to avoid this, you must keep constantly before their 
minds the fact that they are invited to share equally with us all the 
political rights which we ourselves enjoy. It is believed in fact, 
that this is the hinge, upon which the success of your negotiations 
will turn. Let them be convinced, that tiie equality which we 
promise is not imaginary. Let them feel and understand, that they 
are really to be freeman, that they are to be citizens of a Republic, 
in whose Government the voice of each one of them will be as potent 
as that of the highest in our land, that their representation in our 
Legislature will be in proportion to their numbers, which will insure 
to them an equal participation in the making of laws for the future, 
and of repealing such as are now in force, and which may be ob-

noxious. Besides these, many other arguments of a similar nature 
will readily suggest themselves, all of which should be studiously 
arranged, to aid you in the accomplishment of your object. 

In case all obstacles are overcome, you will after taking possesion 
of the CustcMn-House, books, money, archives, etc appoint such per- 
sons to conduct the public business, as in your discretion you may 
think proper, except such oflScers as may be appointed by the Presi- 
dent prior to your departure from this city. In making these ap- 
pointments, the President instructs me to say, that you will restrict 
yourselves to the citizens of Santa f^. To appoint our own citizens to 
fill the public offices among them would excite in their minds distrust 
and opposition at the very outset, which would soon turn to bitter 
hate and open revolt. Whereas,, if the appointments are confined to 
their own citizens, and skillfully managed, it is believed that they 
may.be turned greatly to the advantage of the Government — an 
opportunity to prcMnote the public interest, which it is confidently ex- 
pected, will not be overlooked. 

If after you have arived there, and made yourselves familiar with 
the condition of the country, the character of its inhabitants etc. you 
think it advisable, taking all things into consideration. You may rec- 
ommend, and even urge, them to select from their own citizens dele- 
gates, not to exceed three in number, to be sent to our Seat of Govern- 
ment, during the session of the next CJongress, who may from their 
own personal observation examine into the operations of our system 
of Government, and report to their constituents on their return. 
Although these delegates will not be entitled to a vote on the floor of 
Congress, they will undoubtedly be permitted to occupy seats on it, 
and to speak on any subject that may concern them. It is true that 
no instance of the kind has occured in the history of the Government; 
but from the nature and genius of our institutions, I think you can 
run no risk in assuring them that those privileges will be accorded to 
them. 

One of your Commissioners Col. William G. Cooke, will be com- 
missioned to reside at Sante fe, with the title of Resident Commis- 
sioner, and will be specially instructed in his duty. 

The foregoing instructions are all based upon the supposition that 
no force will be opposed by the citizens of Santa f6 to your reception 
in the capacity in which you go. If however, our expectations should 
not be realized, a case will arise which must be referred almost ex- 
clusively to your discretion. 

The President anxious as he is to have our NaticMial flag ac^owl- 
edged in Santa f6, does not consider it expedient at this time to force 
it upon that portion of the Republic If the Mexican auth(»ities are 
prepared to defend the place with arms, and if you can satisfy your- 
selves that they will be supported by the mass of the people, no good

result can come from risking a battle ; for if our arms are successful, 
a strong Military force would be necessary to hold possession of the 
place, the cost of keeping which, to say nothing of other objections 
equally forcible, would of itself be sufficient; and if they are unfor- 
tunate, the evils that would flow from it are sufficiently apparent. In 
this case therefore, you will not be authorized to risk a battle. 

But if you are opposed by the troops of the Government of Mexico 
only, and the people are with you, or indiferent as to the result, the 
only question for your consideration will be your ability to beat them, 
of which you and the Military officers composing the command must 
be the sole Judges. But in whatever manner you may get possession 
of the City, it seems highly probable that a part of the Military Com- 
mand which will accompany you ought to remain there, after you 
have left You will be authorized therefore, to detach such a portion 
of it as may be willing to volunteer for this service, to be placed 
under the Command of Brevet Brigadier Greneral Hu^ Mcl^eod, 
to whom you will give such instructions as may seem to you best 
calculated to promote the interest of the coimtry, and the object of 
the expedition. 

This Military detachment will be left subordinate to the civil 
authority of this Government, which will be confined to its commis- 
sioner Col William G. Cooke, and will at all times be subject to his 
orders. 

You will distinctly understand the position assumed by the Govern- 
ment to be its right of Jurisdiction. In all your negotiations there- 
fore, you will not be permitted to entertain any proposition for a 
Treaty, which brings that right in question. Policy undoubtedly 
requires that they should be assured there will be no attempt on our 
part to change or modify tiieir mimicipal law, without first obtaining 
their express consent; but Patriotism as certainly requires that at 
the very time of giving this assurance, the right of Congress to do so 
shall be most emphatically asserted. 

As valuable as tiieir trade is considered, and solicitous as the Presi- 
dent is to open its advantages to the citizens of this country, he yet 
owes a paramount duty to the constitution, and has directed me to 
instruct you, that you are to make no arrangement, stipulation or 
agreement whatever with the inhabitants, for the admission of Texan 
goods into that District of of country, by which Texan Citizens will 
be required to pay any duties to them. We claim the jurisdiction, 
and consequently the right to demand the revenue, and if we cannot 
enforce our right, we must at least do nothing to impair it But it is 
believed that they will not only be willing but glad to have the Texan 
tariff substituted for the more onerous one of Mexico, and for the 
purpose of making it more acceptable to them, the collector of the 
customs will be specially instructed by the Secretary of the Treasury

to modify it in such a manner as will accomplish this end. The object 
of the expedition being to conciliate the people of Santa f6, to incor- 
porate them with us, and to secure to our citizens all the benefits aris- 
ing from the valuable trade carried on with them, It may be neces- 
sary to diminish the tariff to a still lower rate to effect these objects; 
but nothing short of necessity will justify any interference with the 
rates established by Congress, and of this necessity the collector of 
the customs must be the Judge. 

The route to be pursued, both going and returning, will be left to 
your own determination, an^ if you should find it expedient or nec^- 
sary to visit any of the Mexican Towns within our limits, while you 
are absent, you will do every thing in your power to cultivate a 
friendly feeling with them, and to create in their minds impressions 
favorable to our laws and institutions, and if any of them should be 
desirous of organizing under our Government, you will consider the 
foregoing general instructions as equally applicable to any such case. 

Thomas Falconer Esqr. will accompany the expedition as histori- 
ographer, and from his labors the President anticipates large and 
valuable accessions to science. In fact, a scientificjftxploration of the 
country is second only in importance to the great National interests 
with which you are more especially charged, and it is therefore ex- 
pected, that every facility in your power will be constantly afforded 
him, to enable him to give such an account of the intermediate coun- 
try and its scientific capacities, as will enable the Government to 
form a correct estimate of its value and extent, and tiie uses to which 
it may be best applied. 

The position which Mr. Falconer will occupy will be that of an 
invited guest. He will receive the same rations etc. as are furnished 
for yourselves, and will be allowed transportation for such additional 
stores, as he may think proper to lay in, on his own account He 
may also take with him an assistant, who will be entitled to trans- 
portation and subsistence, and neither of them will be subject to 
military orders. 

You will take pains to procure all books. Manuscripts, Maps, charts, 
etc. that you may have an opportunity of obtaining, which will serve 
to add to or illustrate the history of ttiis country, or of this continent, 
or which will in any way contribute to the advancement of science 
and general knowledge. 

As a part of these instructions, a copy of those given by this De- 
partment to William G. Dryden, John Rowland, and William Work- 
man Esqrs. commissioners on the part of this Government to Santa 
f^, appointed in April 1840 is attached. Whatever those commis- 
sioners have promised in the name of this Government, within the 
scope of their authority, and not inconsistent with their instructions,

you will be authorized to repeat; but if you find that they have not 
made the explanation of the meaning of term ^^ Indian " in the con- 
stitution, in the manner they are directed to do by their instructions, 
it is thought advisable that it should not now be done, imless it is 
absolutely necessary to the success of your Mission; and even then, 
candor requires that you should distinctly state to them, that the con- 
struction given by the President is not, and cannot be conclusive upon 
the other Departments of the Government Should this subject be 
pressed upon you, it will require much nicety and tact to make such 
an explanation as will be satisfactory to them, and consistent with 
the letter of the constiution. 

It is deemed unnecessary to instruct you that no deception of any 
kind, must be practised upon any of the people with whom you have 
intercourse. Your own high sense of honor, as well as the honor and 
reputation of the Government which is in your keeping, forbid the 
idea. 

A full and faithful report of what you shall -do under your com- 
missions, will be expected from time to time, if you have an oppor- 
tunity of sending it, and a complete history of the expedition on 
your return.

Sir 

A commission is this day drawn up, in which you are named one 
of a joint commission on the part of this Government, to conduct 
the expedition which is now being fitted out for Santa fe. These 
commissioners have been vested with certain powers which are par- 
ticularly enumerated in my letter of instructions to them, of this 
date, which accompanies that commission. 

In order that the policy of the Government may be fully carried 
out, it will in all probability be necessary that some one shall remain 
in Santa fe after the commissioners who are joined with you shall

744 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIOK. 

have left that place, and that this commissioner should be clothed 
with the same authority that has been confered upon them. Accord- 
ingly a separate commission Has been made out appointing you the 
resident Commissioner on the part of this Government at Santa f6, 
whose official duties will only commence when the joint commissioners 
shall have departed or resigned into your hands their authority. 

The duties which will then devolve upon you are many of them 
to be found in the letter of instructions addressed to the joint Com- 
missioners, a copy of which will be furnished to you, and which 
you are to regard as a portion of your instructions as resident com- 
missioner. But as many cases must arise which are not covered by 
those instructions this additional letter becomes necessary. 

Under the instructions already given, you cannot be called upon 
to exercise the functions of your office as Resident Commissioner, 
until after the joint Commissioners have taken possession of the 
Town of Santa fe, organized the Government in accordance with 
their instructions, and installed the officers appointed by this Gov- 
ernment, in their respective offices. It is only necessary therefore, 
to instruct you as to the powers that will be confered on, and the 
duties expected of you, after you are left sole ccnnmissioner. 

A people suddenly transfering their allegiance from one Govern- 
ment to another, where no Treaty stipulations have taken place be- 
tween the two Governments, for the purpose of settling difficult 
points which will necessarally arise in the administration of their 
laws, will, without the exercise of great wisdom and moderation, 
speedily find themselves plimged into anarchy and confusion iu 
every Department of their Government, but more than all in the 
judiciary. 

To guard against such anticipated evils as far as may be, and to 
provide the best remedy for such as cannot be avoided, will constitute 
your principle duty. We are not sufficiently informed, either as to 
their laws or their mode of administering them, to instruct you par- 
ticularly and specifically what innovations you will be allowed to 
make, in every possible case that may be presented — ^general instruc- 
tions only can be given, which will serve you as a guide, and to 
which you are expected rigidly to adhere. 

Of these the Chief are — First. You will not be permitted, either 
directly or indirectly, to make any alterations whatever, (except such 
as are hereinafter particularly mentioned) in any of the laws of that 
country nor in the mode of their administration. 

Second. The tribunals as now constituted will remain inviolate, 
save only the removal of such functionaries as hold their offices di- 
rectly from the Supreme Government of Mexico, and in whose ap- 
pointments the people of Santa f 6 have had no voice. Even these you

will in all cases retain, unless their removal is formaly demanded by 
a written petition from the people, in which case no discretion will 
be allowed you. 

Third. All officers, whether retained or appointed by the joint Com- 
missioners or by you, must take and subscribe an oath of allegiance 
to this Government, and those who are retained must receive anew 
their appointments from the joint Commissioners or from you. 

Fourth. All questions originating in the courts of law, or in any of 
the civil Departments of Government which have heretofore been 
determined by the Governor, will, until further provisions is made, 
be determined also by you; and all appeals that by their laws, lay 
from any of their courts of justice to the higher courts in Mexico, 
or to the Supreme Government thereof, will, except in criminal cases, 
be disallowed ; and the decision of the highest Court of the Country 
to which, by their laws, any appeal may be taken, shall be final and 
conclusive, until further provisions is made by Congress; but in all 
criminal cases, the same power to pardon that is now vested in the 
Governor of that province, or in the Chief Executive of Mexico, 
may be exercised by you. 

Fifth. It will be important to put the country as soon as possible 
in a state of defence, and for this purpose, unless the measure is 
found to be unpopular with the people, you are instructed to Organize 
as rapidly as possible the whole country under our Militia System, 
ordering elections at proper times for Military officers only, and you 
will do all in your power to foster a Military spirit in the people, so 
as to prepare them to repel any attack which Mexico may hereafter 
make upon their liberties. 

The collector of the customs will be charged exclusively with the 
financial, as you will be with the political Department. He will re- 
ceive from the Secretary of the Treasury special instructions in 
regard to the modification of the tariff, which will be conclusive on 
you also; and you will at all times lend him all the aid in your 
power, to carry into effect such modifications as he may make under 
them. When he is inducted into office, all the money and public 
property will be handed over to him, and over neither the one nor 
the other will you be permitted to exercise any control. Reason- 
able requisitions for the subsistence of the Military force, and the 
necessary. Contingent expenses for the Civil Department, will be paid 
by him ; but of their reasonableness he must be the sole judge, as he 
will be held responsible to this Government for every useless and 
extravagant expenditure of the public money. 

The foregoing instructions, as well as the instructions to the joint 
Commissioners, are all grounded upon the broad principle that not 
a single alteration or innovation should be made in the laws, usages,

or customs, of the people of that country, which the change in their 
Government does not render absolutely necessary, nor any rights or 
privileges, power or authority, conferred either upon you, or upon 
the joint commissioners which are not also absolutely necessary for 
the purpose of conciliating the people of that province, and of firmly 
uniting them with the rest of the Republic. In short no alteration 
whatever will be made, either in the Municipal law, the modes of 
procedure in their courts, or in conducting their public affairs, which 
do not, of necessity, follow from the new position in which they will 
be placed, by the change in their Government. The object of this 
Government is only to provide a substitute for that which of neces- 
sity will be taken away. To go beyond this, will be to transcend 
both the spirit and letter of your instructions, and to diregard the 
pledges already given, and now repeated by the President, in his 
letter to the people of that country. Congress only can make and 
unmake laws; but even Congress can make no laws that will be bind- 
ing upon them, until they, in common with every other citizen of 
this Republic, are fully represented in that body. All this you will 
continually bear in mind, and in such emergencies as may arise, not 
anticipated in either letter of instructions, your decision will be so 
framed as to accord with this principle. 

You will lose no opportunity of communicating with this Depart- 
ment, and as far as possible, will keep it informed of all your official 
acts. You will also take pains to collect and transmit to this Depart- 
ment such statistical information as may be relied on, concerning the 
inhabitants of that portion of New Mexico which falls within our 
limits, stating partictilarly what portion of them are Indians, what 
mixed blood etc The number of Towns, their population, trade, 
wealth etc will also constitute a part of your enquiries, as well also, 
as the modes in which they are governed, especially if by any separate 
or peculiar code 

Upon a full review of all the instructions that have been furnished 
to you, you cannot fail to be struck with the large discretion with 
which you have been invested. Goubernatorial authority has been 
unavoidably placed in your hands, power has been given which if 
misapplied, would render nugatory every effort to accomplish the 
object of your Mission; and a latitude has been allowed you, in con- 
struing your instructions, which opens a wide door for good or evil. 
With the utmost care and circumspection this could not be avoided, 
without depriving you of all efficiency in your office, and rendering 
the whole enterprise useless and valueless. 

The weight of responsibility which will therefore rest on yon 
will be very great. That you will prove yourself fully equal to it, I

doubt not; but nevertheless you cannot exercise too much caution. 
Let it be an established maxim with you, to undo as little as pos- 
sible, and to shape all your acts after models drawn from our own 
institutions.

Austin City June Hth 1841 
Gentlemen, 

Herewith you will receive a letter from the President directed to 
General Mariano Arista, Commanding the Northern Army of Mex- 
ico, which empowers you to visit the Headquarters of said Army for 
the purpose of coming to some understanding with its commander, 
upon the subject of the irregular and brigand border warfare which 
has unhappily for so long a period desolated our western frontier, 
stripping our citizens of their hard earned property, depriving them 
of their liberty, and even in many instances of their lives. 

The President from the very conunencement of his administration, 
down to the present time has always kept one object steadily and 
permanently in view, which was to afford all the protection in the 
power of the Government to give to our widely extended frontier, 
and to keep as many channels for a safe and lucrative trade open to 
the enterprize of our citizens, as the slender means in his power would 
warrant him in undertaking. In pursuance of this policy he always 
regarded the trade to the Northern States of Mexico as of immense 
importance, not only to our entire western frontier, but to the whole 
country at large; and has never omitted an opportunity to promote it 
by all honorable means, 

A circumstance has recently occurred, which induces the belief in 
the mind of the President, that he may now interpose with effect, 
and establish on a firm and he trusts a lasting footing a safe and 
friendly commerce with that portion of the Mexican territory border- 
ing on and to the westward of the Rio Grande. Informal overtures 
have been made by the Commanding General of the Army of the 
North, which the President could not entertain for reasons which 
were assigned to the bearer of the propositions, and which to his 
mind, (the Presidents) seemed conclusive, to say nothing of other 
objections which might have been urged. But altho he could not 
for a moment listen to any propositions coming from an enemy, for 
the invasion of our soil imder any pretext whatever; yet as the Mexi- 
can Genl seems, if the Verbal assurances of his agent may be trusted, 
to manifest a willingness on his part to put a stop to the miserable 
system of robbery which has been so harrassing and injurious to our 
citizens it does not become the Chief Executive of a brave and gener- 
ous people to refuse his cooperation. He is not however willing to 
trust anything to chance, but would satisfy himself by reports of his 
own agents, how far he may safely rely upon the assurances of G^nL 
Arista and what are the steps he proposes to take, and the means he 
proposes to use, to accomplish the end in view. To perform this duty,

you have been selected, and that you may not be at a loss as to the 
exact nature of the service required, or, the extent of the powers con- 
fided to you, it is particularly enjoined on you, to observe the follow- 
ing instructions, which you are to regard as secret. 

1st. You are not to make or listen to any propositions from any 
quarter whatever, which would commit this country in the slightest 
degree in any of their domestic wars or revolutions. 

2d. You will give no assurances on the part of this Government that 
Mexican Troops will be permitted to invade our territory, either 
under the pretext of chastizing the savages or any other. 

3d. You will in no manner interfere in any political movement in 
the country, nor intermeddle in any way in their domestic Govern- 
ment. 

In short, you will scrupulously confine yourselves to the single 
object of your Mission, the prevention of robbery and Murder, and the 
opening of a safe trade to the border river. This much, humanity 
requires, and the interests of the country demand. You will make a 
faithful report to this Department of all the steps you may think 
proper to take in this business, giving at the same time all such general 
information as you many think will be of use ; taking particular care 
to keep your Mission and the object of it entirely secret until after 
you have accomplished the purpose for which you go. 

The President relies greatly on your address and discretion in the 
management of this affair, and expects that nothing will be done 
which will in the remotest degree reflect upon the honor of the Nation, 
or which would be likely when known, to throw any impediments in 
the way of the treaty which we are now seeking to establish with

years past on the adjoining frontiers of Texas and Mexico, and which 
of late divested of almost every feature of a National contest between 
two countries, has become little other than a system of predatory in- 
cursion and foray, attended with no other results than the pillage 
and ruin of exposed and unoffending citizens and settlements. This 
state of things is not only destructive to the interests of important 
sections of both countries, but is disreputable to the character of 
enlightened and honorable people, and should not be suffered to con- 
tinue any longer. Degrading the profession of arms into robbery 
and murder, this speciegjof warfare can only lead to crime and indi- 
vidual sufferings, without tending in the least degree towards the 
adjustment of the difficulties between the two nations. Besides this 
a negociation is now going on in Mexico, with a fair prospect of a 
speedy and an honorable settlement of our National quarrel by a treaty 
of permanent peace, — a consideration sufficient of itself to induce a 
suspension of all hostilities for the present, and more particularly for 
the abolishment of a petty and provoking mode of warfare, which is 
calculated to engender perstwial feuds and revengeful feelings which 
may linger upon the border even after peace has been established. 
Should these negociations fail, and either party shall choose to 
enter again the arena of war, the contest ought to be a National one 
and should be conducted in a manner consonant with the character 
of the contending parties. Texas on her part, will never vary from 
the dignity and humanity belonging to civilized warfare, unless 
driven from it by some intolerable conduct of her adversary. Believ- 
ing that you are actuated by the high and honorable feelings which 
always belong to true heroes, and that it is only necessary to call 
your attention to the evils alluded to, to secure your co-operation in 
putting an end to them, I have appointed two gentlemen of honor 
and talents, Cornelius Van Ness and John D. Morris Esqrs to make 
known to you the feelings and views of this Oovernment, and have 
authorized them to enter into any arrangement with you which might 
place the relations and intercourse between the two frontiers (even 
though hostile) upon a higher and more honorable footing, and which 
while advancing the interests and ameliorating the situation of many, 
will not compromit the dignity or character of either nation. I 
have also instructed these gentlemen to refrain most scrupulously 
from the least interference in the domestic or local affairs of yotir 
Country, but devote their attention exclusively to the object of their 
Commission. 

Respectfully Yours,

Hon James S. Mayfield 

Secretary of State 

Sir : I have the honor to hand you herewith, a copy of the corre- 
spondence which has recently passed between Her Britanic Majesty's 
Minister at Mexico, and myself, relative to the objects of my late mis- 
sion to that country, and from which you will perceive, that the 
Government of Mexico has not only refused to receive the propositions 
which I was authorized to make for the adjustment of difference, but 
has positively rejected the mediation of the British Government, in 
the settlement of those differences. 

Upon my arrival at Sacrificios, I addressed through my Secretary, 
a letter to the Commandant General of Vera Cruz, informing him of 
the objects of my visit, and requesting to know whether or not I 
would be permitted to land, 'and furnished with passports to the City 
of Mexico; to which letter I received a reply, couched in terms of 
suflScient courtesy, saying that he was not authorized to permit the 
one or grant the other. I then addressed my first communication to 
Mr Pakenham, through the British Vice Consul at Vera Cruz, and 
sixteen days afterwards received the answer and accompanying docu- 
ments which you will find enclosed. 

It may be proper to remark that there was nothing in the deport- 
ment of the authorities at Vera Cruz, as exhibited to me, which was in 
the slightest degree offensive ; but having been placed upon my guard 
by a knowledge of the extraordinary treatment manifested towards 
the vessel (on board of which I was) but a short time before, while 
under a flag of truce, I caused enquiries to be made of the Command- 
ant General, to ascertain whether or not she would be permitted to 
remain quietly in the Harbor, until such time as I should receive 
answers to my despatches addressed to Mr Pakenham ; and was in- 
formed in reply, that he (the Commandant (Jeneral) could make 
no pledges of any sort, farther than that he felt no hostility either 
towards myself or the Vessel. Under these circumstances, I deemed

it most proper to leave the Harbor, which I did by proceeding to the 
Island of Lobos, where I remained until a sufficient time had elapsed 
to justify the expectation of receiving replies from Mexico upon my 
return to Vera Cruz. 

After my rejection by the authorities at Mexico, it was my inten- 
tion to have proceeded at once to Tobasco and Yucatan, for the pur- 
pose of complying with your instructions- in reference to those States, 
but while prosecuting that intention, we had the misfortune to carry 
away the foremast of our Vessel, which compelled an immediate 
return to this place, where we arrived at a late hour last night. 

As I have some doubts about the propriety of my setting out again 
for Yucatan and Tobasco under the instructions with which I am at 
present furnished, I have written to His Excellency the President 
upon the subject, and shall remain here until I hear from you in 
reference to my future movements. My Secretary, Mr. George L. 
Hammeken, is the bearer of my despatches, and as he is fully advised 
of all my views in reference to this Mission, I beg leave to refer you 
to him for an explanation of all things, in which I have not been 
sufficiently explicit in my written communications. 

Should it be determined by the President to furnish me with 
further p"owers and instructions in regard to the States of Yucatan 
and Tobasco, I beg that you will cause them to be made out with as 
little delay as possible, as I shall await the return of Mr. Hammekai 
with great anxiety. I would also suggest, that in such case, the 
Commissions and letters of Credence for each State should be sepa- 
rate — ^the letters of Credence to be addressed to the Governors of each. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect 
Your Obt Servt

Sir: ' ' 

In accordance with the Convention entered into on the 14th of 
November last,* between Her Britanic Majesty's Government and 
the Republic of Texas, I have been deputed by His Excellency the 
President of Texas to make such propositions to the Government of 
Mexico for the adjustment of differences, as will enable you to carry 
into effect the objects contemplated by that Convention, in the event 
that Mexico shall accept the offered mediation of Great Britain, 

Upon my arrival here on yesterday, I addressed a note to the Com- 
mander of Her Majesty's ship Comus, a copy of which is herewith 
forwarded you. To this note I received a verbal reply from Com- 
mander Nepear,*^ stating that he was compelled to proceed to sea by 
the first wind, but while he remained in port, he would afford me the 
protection asked. He also immediately despatched a boat to Town, 
to ascertain whether or not any instructions had been received from

754 AMBfilCAN HI6T0RI0AL A680CUTION. 

Mexico, in rotBrence to the reoeption of an agent from Tiexas nnder 
the Convention with Her Maj^ty'a GoTemment; but to this inquiry 
no satisfactory [answer] was received, as it was said, the Commandant 
of the port was absent, and Her Majesty's Consul had no information 
upon the subject 

By the advice of Conmiander Xepear, I this morning despatched 
my Secretary to Town under the protection of Her Majesty's flag, 
with instructions to have an interview if possible with the Com- 
mandant of the place, and to ascertain whether or not, I would be 
permitted to land, and proceed to Mexico — and if not, whether the 
flag of truce under which I came into this Harbor would be respected, 
and the vessel be allowed to remain until I could communicate with 
you at Mexico? My Secretary having failed to obtain the interview 
desired, addressed a note to the Commandant, to which T received 
the accompanying reply, and by which I am informed, that I cannot 
be permitted to proceed to Mexico. I am further informed, that 
the Commandant verbally stated to Her Majesty's Consul through 
whom Mr Hammekens note was conveyed, that the vessel could not 
be permitted to remain in this Harbor, but that she might return at a 
future day to receive the answers to the despatches which might be 
forwarded to Mexico. I have therefore no alternative, but to address 
you upon this subject, and proceed to sea, with the intention of 
returning in ten or fifteen days for your answers. 

You will perceive that by the terms of the Convention (a copy of 
which with its ratification by the Grovemment of Texas I have the 
honor herewith to foward you) that my Grovemment has undertaken 
to pay One Million of pounds Sterling of Mexican foreign debt, pro- 
vided a Treaty of peace is entered into between the two Countries 
through the mediation of your Government ; and it is for the purpose 
of enabling you to offer that Mediation in the most effectual manner, 
and to negotiate such a treaty, that I now present myself to the au- 
thorities of this C/Ountry, to make such propositions for the adjust- 
ment of our differences, as it is hoped, will lead to that most desirable 
end. My powers are very full, as Conunissioner ; and also Minister 
Plenipotentiary should I be received as such, in each of which charac- 
ters I am furnished with letters of credence to His Excellfflioy the 
President of Mexico. 

Herewith, I also beg leave to hand you the copy of a letter ad- 
dressed by the Secretary of State of Texas to you, in reference to the 
object of my Mission ; * and also the copy of a letter frcnn A T. Bum- 
ley Esqr.^ (lately associated with Gten. Hamilton in Europe in the 
negotiation of a loan) Mr Burnley's letter covers one from Lord 
Palmerston which being ynder seal cannot be copied. I would for-

ward the oiriginals of these, instead of the copies, together with Ijord 
Palmerston's letter, had I not been advised to retain them until I 
could deliver them personally, on account of the risks which a con- 
veyance by mail involves. 

I cannot believe that when the olive branch of peace is a third time 
tendered to Mexico, it will a third time be refused, especially as it 
will not be pffered imder circumstances which are evidently so de- 
cidedly advantageous to her, and may be accepted without infljcting 
the slightest wound on her national pride. We now present our- 
selves rather in the character of purchasers of the country, than as 
conquerors, and as such, Mexico can Treat with us with as little mor- 
tification of feeling as though hostilities had never existed, I there- 
fore sincerely hope that you will have no serious difficulty in obtain- 
ing from the authorities at Mexico, permission for myself and Secre- 
tary to land at Vera Cruz and to- proceed to Mexico for the purpose 
of entering into such negotiations as may result in the establishment 
of a peace not only mutually advantageous to both Countries, but 
which will be permanent in its Character. 

In compliance with what I have understood to be the desire of the 
Commandant of Vera Cniz, I shall proceed to sea tomorrow morning, 
but shall return again to this Harbor as soon after the expiration of 
ten days from this time, as the vicissitudes of the weather will permit, 
under the hope of then receiving from you an answer to this com- 
munication, and permission from the authorities at Mexico to proceed 
in the object of my mission. 

I have written to no one at Mexico besides yourself, believing that 
an application for my reception made by you, would be much more 
likely to succeed than if addressed by me to any officer of the Gov- 
ernment ; and having been assured that you would do whatever was 
necessary to be done, in reference to this matter. 

I have the honor to be, with great ccMisideration and respect 
Your very Obt hble. Servt

the answer contained in the enclosed copy of a note from the Minister

for foreign affairs, which the Mexican Government have returned to 
my communication announcing your arrival at Vera Cruz, and the 
object of your Mission to this country. 

This answer, you will perceive, is altogether unfavorable, as it 
makes known the present determination of the Government not to 
depart from the line of Conduct with reference to Texas which, by a 
note addressed to this mission, a copy of which I also enclose, they 
signified their intention to observe when the good offices of Her 
Britanic Majesty's Government were first offered, with a view to 
bring about a pacific arrangement between the two Republics. 

I think it necessary to observe to you that this determination has 
been taken by the Government of Mexico before they have had official 
communication of the convention of the 14th November 1840; in fact, 
I have not yet been instructed by Her Majesty's Government to make 
that communication, although by permission of Viscount Palmerston, 
the substance of the convention was some time since confidentially 
made known to them. 

It accordingly occurs to me that it may, perhaps, suit the views of 
the Texan Government, whose policy I imagine it to be to avoid com- 
ing to extremities with this country, to allow the question to remain 
upon this footing for the present, and to wait for an opportunity to 
reattempt negotiation under more favorable circumstances. 

I have, on various occasions, taken the liberty to express to the 
gentlemen acting for the Government of Texas, with whcrni I have 
had the honor to communicate, my conviction that it is entirely foi: 
the interest of Texas to forbear from any acts of hostility or aggres- 
sion towards Mexico, as long as Mexico refrains from active hostil- 
ities against that country. 

The Government of Texas, I have no doubt, possess sufficient in- 
formation as to what passes in this country to enable them to judge 
how far it is possible that Mexico will be able, and how soon, to 
undertake an expedition upon a scale to endanger the safety and in- 
dependence of Texas. The longer such an expedition is postponed, 
the less likely it becomes that it should ultimately take place, unless 
Texas should in the mean time by some act of aggression offend the 
pride of the Mexicans, and lead them to put in action the means 
which they undoubtedly possess, if properly directed, of causing 
serious annoyance to Texas. This opinion I now beg leave most con- 
scientiously to repeat, as a sincere well wisher of both parties. 

My commission as mediator, I consider, notwithstanding the pres- 
ent unfavorable disposition of the Mexican Government, to be still 
open, hoping that I may one day enjoy the satisfaction of seeing an 
arrangement effected between the two countries, neither of which, I 
am well convinced, could be otherwise than prejudiced by becoming 
assailant of the other.

I shall not fail to make known to the Government of Texas any in-

it my duty to attend, to the best of my ability, to any communica- 
tion which the Texan Government may think proper to address to 
me having relation to that subject. 

You will perhaps have the goodness to cause to be delivered to her

pleased to impart to him the arrival at Vera Cruz of the Commis- 
sioner from Texas for the purpose of making propositions to the 
Supreme Government on the adjustment of the difficulties existing 
between Mexico and that Department, expressing the earnest de- 
sire of Her Britanic [Majesty's] Government that the opportunity 
now presented to conclude them upon honorable and advantageous 
terms will not be refused 

Having placed before His Excellency the President of the Re- 
public this communication in order that he might accord that which 
is most suitable to a subject apparently of so much importance. 
His Excellency after a most mature and deliberate examination 
has been pleased to instruct me to answer Senr. Pakenham, as I have 
the honor to do, that the Government of Mexico has had no reason 
to change her opinion, thereby ceasing to appreciate the question of 
Texas in the same manner in which she appreciated it, when she 
contested* on the same subject with Mr Pakenham, which informa- 
tion is to be found in the note to that effect which the Minister ad- 
dressed to him on the 11th December 1839.

highly regrets not being able to serve his ardent desires of obtain- 
ing it. But His Excellency the President not being able to depart 
from the principles of honor and justice which prohibit him from 
recognizing a dismemberment of the territory, and sanctioning the 
most remarkable act of ingratitude, with which it could have corre- 
sponded to a magnanimous and generous nation, usurping those rich 
lands when she exercised her hospitality with those who came to 
seek it. Besides Mr Pakenham is not ignorant that since the com- 
mencement of the insurrection of the Department of Texas, innumer- 
able slaves have been, and are continuing to be introduced, that trade 
from which humanity turns with horror, and for which cause alone, 
even if there were no others, the Mexican Republic and its Govern- 
ment never would bind themselves to an act equivalent to the sanc- 
tion and recognition of Slavery

Texan Schooner San Berkabd 

Saarificios^ 16th Jvne 1841. 
Sir, 

I have the hwior to acknowledge the receipt of your communication 
of the IQth inst in answer to mine of the first, aiul by whiph, and the 
documents accompanying it, I am informed of the determination of 
the Mexican Government to listen to no overtures of pacification frcwu 
mine, predicated upon the separation of what it terms the Depart- 
ment of Texas from Mexico. 

I can but regret this determination, as I fear it will lead to a State 
of things which every philanthropist must depreciate, and which my 
Government has been heretofore most anxious to avoid. That the 
authorities of Texas have sincerely desired to pursue a pacific policy 
toyrards Mexico, is abundantly evinced in the repeated efforts which 
have been made to settle by amicable negotiations the differences exist- 
ing betwen the two Countries; and especially, in prosecuting those 
efforts under the most discouraging circumstances, and at times too, 
when had they been disposed to renew hostilities, the internal feuds 
and external difficulties of Mexico, afforded the most inviting oppor- 
tunities of doing so. 

You are no doubt aware, that repeated overtures have been made 
by the Federalists of the Northern and Southern provinces of Mexico, 
accompanied by the most alluring offers, to induce the people of Texas 
to unite with them in a war against their Government, and to make 
common cause in forcing an acknowledgement of our and their Inde- 
pendence ; and you are no doubt equally aware that all of these over- 
tures have been rejected on the part of my Government. This course 
was pursued by us under the impression, that Mexico appreciating 
the motives of our forbearance, and perceiving the amicable spirit 
which Texas was disposed to cultivate towards her, would change her 
policy in reference to us — a policy, which, without incurring the 
imputation of boasting we think we may confidently assert, can never 
result in any benefit to her. 

What course my Government will feel itself bound to pursue in 
reference to this controversy in future, I am imprepared to say. One 
thing is certain, having voluntarily made three distinct effcH^ for 
amicable negotiations. She can never make a fourth unless invited to 
it ? Your suggestions of a continuance of the pacific policy heretofore 
adopted, shall be duly made known, and I have no doubt will have 
great weight; but the people of Texas generally, have received so 
much annoyance from the disturbed condition of her frontier, and 
from the repeated, tho' hitherto unmeaning threats of invasion, that 
they would decidedly prefer an active and energetic prosecution of the 
war, to the state of suspense and sullen hostility which has existed 
between the two Nations for the last five years; and altho' the Gov-

ernment might be disposed to longer forbearance, I think it possible 
that so general an expression of public Sentiment may exercise an in- 
fluence on the public councils which can no longer be resisted. 

The c(Mnmunication from Viscount Palmerston to which I referred 
in my last^ I have now the honor of enclosing to you, tho' from the 
letter of Mr Burnley, I presume it cannot in the present posture of 
affairs be rendered available. I have also the honor of enclosing to 
you the original letter of the Secretary of State of Texas, to the copy 
of which heretofore forwarded, I have received your reply addressed 
to that officer. 

I cannot close this conmiunication without tendering to you my 
sincere thanks, as well as those of the President of Texas, for the 
many acts of kindness and friendship which you have exhibited 
towards our infant nati(Hi. Be assured Sir, they are all fully appre-

Gal\t:ston, 2P. June 181^1. 
My dear General, 

I arrived here last night from the Coast of Mexico, having been 
compel'd to return in consequence of the loss of our foremast at sea, 
when only one half of my duties had been performed. By my in- 
structions I was directed, if not received at Mexico, to proceed to 
Tabasco and Yucatan, and ascertain what course those two States, 
and the other Federalists of Mexico in Combination with them, would 
be willing to pursue in the event of Texas renewing the War with the 
Central Government; and it was while proceeding from Vera Cruz 
to Tobasco for the purpose of carrying out that branch of my in- 
structions, that our foremast was carried away, and the Sdiooner 
so crippled as to render a farther prosecution of the Voyage im- 
practicable. 

From my letter to the Secretary of State of this date, and the Cor- 
respondence which accompanies it, you will perceive that all expecta- 
tion of ever accomplishing any thing hy negotiation with the present

Government of Mexico, is at an end. They declare emphatically, 
that they will never discuss, or ever receive propositions, frowt any 
source whatever^ which have for their object, the seperation of Texas 
from Mexico. After an avowal so positive and imequivocal in its 
character, backed too as it is, by the prompt rejection of our Over- 
tures, and the Mediation of England, there can be but one question 
left for our discussion. That question is, whether it is better for us 
to let things remain as they are, or to take such steps without farther 
delay, as will coerce an acknowledgement of our rights? If we per- 
mit the question to remain as it is, unsettled; especially when it is 
known that Mexico has a third time rejected our efforts at Amicable 
negotiation, and rejected them in terms, which must preclude all 
farther efforts of that sort from us, I think we run a great risk of 
destroying all ccmfidence abroad in the Stability of our Government, 
and will most certainly risk [sinking] our already prostrate credit 
still lower than it is, if it be possible for it to get lower. One of the 
greatest evils under which we have heretofore labor'd, has been the 
want of a full confidence in other countries, in the permanence of Our 
institutions. It has been impossible to produce a conviction with 
those, unacquainted with the Mexican Character, and with ourselves, 
that a Nation possessing a population of 8 Millions of inhabitants, 
could not at any moment reconquer a revolted province with a popu- 
lation of less than 150 thousand ; and the impression that it could be 
done, has heretofore kept from our shores that class of emigration 
which alone can give wealth, Credit, and Character to the Country — 
an impression which must gain additional strength from the haughty 
manner in which Mexico has rejected our third proposition for 
concilliation. 

Heretofore, as you well know, I have been an advocate of the pa- 
cific policy pursued by your administration. I advocated it, because 
I believed that the War could not be renewed and prosecuted success- 
fully without much greater resources than our embarrassed finances 
would enable the Government to command, and that an unsuccessful 
effort, so far from relieving us, would place the Country in a worse 
attitude than it already occupied ; but my recent trip to the Coast of 
Mexico, and information which I have obtained from various sources 
of the Condition of that Country, has worked a thorough change in 
my opinions, and I now Conscientiously believe that we can renew 
the War, and Conduct it to a successful termination for all our pur- 
poses, without its costing the Nation a single dollar in the end. To 
explain myself satisfactorily, it is necessary to take a very cursory 
view of the present posture of affairs in that Country. Yucatan and 
Tobasco, two of the most important states of Mexico, as you are 
aware, have already seceded, and declared themselves independent of 
the existing Government. Their object is not to establish for them-

selwB, seperate and independent (jovemments, but to rest<n« the C<m- 
federation, and reestabliki the Constitution of 1824, with such modi- 
fications as eicperience have taught them are essential to its preserva- 
tion. In doing this, however, they ha\'e no expectation or desire of 
uniting Teonts with that Confederation, for they are fully convinced, 
that with a populati<m like ours, composed of persons of manners, 
habits, education and religion, so different from their own, there never 
could be harmony in a strict union, and that in establishing such an 
Union, they would be planting in it the seeds of discord which would 
eventually overthrow their own fabric. They are therefore perfectly 
willing to give us up, and to form such amicable relations with us 
eon a foreign povyer^ as will be to the mutual convenience and benefit of 
both. Indeed, I am assured, that they are now anxious to form such 
relations "upon a permanent basis, because they feel convinced, that 
with our assistance and support, they can in a short time put down 
the Central Government, and establish the Confederacy in its stead. 
The plan proposed is this. Let Texas enter into arrangements at 
onoe, with Yncatan and Tdbasco, and each party mutually recognize 
the Independence of the other, and then let them conjointly renew 
and prosecute the War untill the Central Government shall be forced 
into terms, or put down beyond the hope of resuscitation. In renew- 
ing the War cOTi jointly with Yucatan and Trfjasco, Texas would only 
be expected to furnish her Navy, — the whole of the land cq)erations to 
be carried on by the Federalists, and by which means we would be 
saved the entire expense of keeping an Army in the field. The Cap- 
tures made by the Navy would not only pay the expenses incur'd in 
keeping it afloat, but would absolutely produce a Revenue to the 
Country. In making arrangements of this sort, it should be dis- 
tinctly understood that ovfr object is not farther c(mquest, but simply 
the a(^owlegeme9it of our Independence — the permanent establish- 
ment of our rights of Territory as now claimed, and a full remuner- 
ation for the expenses ^ e may incur in carrying on the War. Let it 
also be understood that we do not intend to interfere with the Confed- 
eration of the States, to the South and West of the Rio Grande, biit 
will aid in its restoration and instead of finding enemies in the Fed- 
eralists which are scattered all over the Country, and composing near 
two thirds of the entire population, (as we should do were we to* 
carry on the War alone) we will find in them active and ssealous Co- 
operators and 8upiKMl«rs. With the disaffection at present prevail- 
ing in all the Towns along the Coast, which are now subject to the 
Central power, I am fuly convinced that our Navy could Capture 
every one of them, if it were understood we made the attack [as] 
friends and supporters of the Federal cause, because I am satisfied 
that at least one half of the population would be ready to aid us, and 
would throw off the yofce of centralism so soon as they found that

they wcmld be sustained in their rebellion. Without a land force 
however, we oould not hold their Towns after they were Captured, 
but in this arrangements with the Federalists, let it be understood 
that when we had taken possission, and remunerated ourselves from 
the public Coffers for liie expense of tide Capture, the Towns should 
be given up to them. And we would imaiediaiely find them ready to 
relieve us from all farther trouble in respect to them. 

The Federalists of Yucatan and Tobasco have now everything that 
is necessary to carry on the War successfully, but a Navy, and they 
want no aasistwiice from us but such as the Navy would a;ff(n-d. With- 
out a Navy tiiey can make no eflectuai impression upcm tiie Sea ports, 
and tbmt is the most essential object to be obtained ; because it is 
through the sea ports and the revenue derived from their Commerce 
that the Government is sustained — ^take away that, and you cut off all 
their resources and render them hepdiesdy imbecile. Hence the great 
anidety of the Federalists to make temis witii us, because they be- 
lieve with our assistance in taking their ports, th^ can inmiediately 
bring the Central party down. 

Is it not important then for us to avail ourselves of this most aus- 
pioioms moment to make terans wit^ them ? I repeat, there is no hope 
of ever atchieving anything by n^otiation with the Central Govern- 
ment of Mexico. We must eitiier remain as we are, or fight them. If 
we remain as we are, I again say, I fear confidence in the permanence 
of our Government abroad will be greatly impaired, and mir credit 
wholly prostrated, and if we £gbt alone, independently of the Fed- 
eral party, we have no hopes of success, because the Mexicans with 
all their political hostility to each other, will imite to repel us if they 
think we invade them solely for our own benefit, or for the purpose of 
Conquest. They hate each other with a hatred bitter enough, but thqr 
hate hereticks with a bitterness ten times greater, and are particularly 
jealous of the encroachments of the Texians. They have no idea of 
friendship unaccompanied with services, but serve them, and they 
win be grateful. 

By my instructions, I am not authoriised to make any decisive or 
permanent arrangement with the Grovemments of Yucatan and To- 
basco. I was directed in a certain event, simply to proceed to those 
states, and ascertain if I could, what course they would pursue should 
we renew the War ; and had we not lost our foremast, I should have 
gone down and complied litterally witti my instructions, without mak- 
ing any engagement on our part; but as I have been compel'd to put 
back, would it not be better before I proceed a 8ec<md time, (should 
it be thought advisable for me to go on) to furnish me with more 
ample powers and instructions? It is for the purpose of submitting 
tliis question, and my deliberate views upon the subject, that I have 
sent up my Secretary to ooaler with yo«. Having been already better

than six weeks at sea, confined to a small, close, hot and foul cabin, 
only gix feet square, I can feel no desire to return to sea again, unless 
some object is to be attained by it, advantageous to the Country, and 
what with me is almost as important, creditable to your administra- 
tion. I think if active steps are taken, the War may be renewed, and 
consequences most important to the Nation be atchieved by it, before 
your administration closes. At all events, the War can be renewed, 
and placed upon such a footing by you as will preclude your successor 
from discontinuing it, and your administration will have the Credit 
of it. Should Genl. Houston succeed in the Presidential Canvass 
(and of this there is now the strongest probability) I understand that 
he will be opposed to a renewal of the war.' Unless therefwe it is 
done in your time, we may expect an additional three years of doubt, 
difficulty, and embarrassment 

But suppose the war is not renewed, will not something be gained 
for us by obtaining from Yucatan and Tobasco, the two most power- 
ful and Conmiercial states of Mexico, the unconditional acknowledge- 
ment of our Independence, together with the assurance of obtaining a 
similar acknowledgement from the other states, as they shall throw 
off the Central Yoke and unite with the Confederacy? The acknowl- 
edgement of Yucatan and Tobasco alone, will exercise an influence on 
the other States when the Confederacy is established, too powerful to 
be resisted, and that the Confederacy will eventually be reestablished, 
1 have not the shadow of a doubt ; at all events, untill it is reestab- 
lished, we shall never get our Independence acknowledged by Mexico. 

I can see no benefit that will result to the Country, or to your ad- 
ministration for me now to go to Yucatan and Tobasco under my 
l^resent instructions. If it be intended by you to renew the War, I 
ought to be authorized to make full arrangements at once, as we have 
no time to loose. If on the other hand, it should be thought most 
advisable not to renew it, it can be of no service for me to ascertain 
what course those states would pursue in an event which is not to 
happen. Unless therefore, I am instructed to make positive arrange- 
ments with them for Conjoint Operations against our Conunon enemy, 
or to obtain from them a recognition of our Independence so far as 
they can give it, I respectfully suggest the propriety of my recall. In 
making this suggestion, I hope I will not be understood as manifest- 
ing any desire to shrink from a duty which I had previously under- 
taken, and which properly devolves upon me. I do it from a full 
Conviction, thjtt under my present instructions, I diall not be able to 
render any effectual service to the Country. 

Should you think it the better policy to renew the war immediately, 
provided it can be done at so little cost and hazard (and of this I can 
hardly entertain a doubt) I feel it to be my duty to call your atten- 
tion to the act of the last Congress directing the Navy to be laid up

in Ordinary, because it is the Navy alone which will be required or 
can be effectual in such a War. I do not recollect the terms of thai 
act or whether any discretion is left to the President in bringing it 
into service. If there be no such discretion allowed, is it not a matter 
of sufficient importance to justify a Call of Ccmgress? This would 
cause but little delay, as the Vessels could be getting ready while the 
Members were assembling. I do not know that Galveston presents 
any criterion from which to judge of public sentiment, but if there be 
one tenth of the war fervor in the other parts of the Republic that is 
felt here, the Nation would justify by acclamation the sending the 
Navy to sea, even without the action of Congress to authorize it I 
however for one, would not advise you to do it. 

You will perceive from Mr. Packenhams letters both to the Sec- 
retary of State and myself, that he advises us still to pursue the peace 
policy. I call your attention to the fact, because I assured him I 
would do so, but at the same time I must say, that I think his advice 
upon the subject is not entitled to as much consideration as it doubt- 
less would be on most others. He is in feeling and interest, essen- 
tially a Mexican of the Central party. He Married in the Country 
and has all his interests established there, and he would therefore 
not advise a Course injurious to that interest. He no doubt would 
be pleased to see Mexico recognize the Independence of Texas, be- 
cause he has sense enough to know that it would be to her advantage 
to do so and I am strongly inclined to believe that the larger portion 
of his gratification would be derived from that consideration. 

If the War should be renewed, I understand that there are several 
persons here desirous of fitting out privateers, and [they] are anxious 
to know whether Commissions could be had for them as letters of 
Marque. I have heard that Col. Love and Capt. Wheelwright speak 
of fitting out one, to be under the command of the latter. 

Bjiowing your aversion to reading long letters, I am almost 
ashamed of sending you this tedious and desultory scrall. But being 
anxious to put you fully in possession of my views upon a subject 
which I regard as of great importance, and having no time to think 
of perspicuity in style (as I have many other letters to write before 
Mr. Hammeken leaves in the morning) I have just put down the 
things which were suggested to my mind at the time, and shall not 
be able even to look them over for the purpose of correction, but be- 
tween you and I, this is a matter of but little consequence. 

Should you conclude to send me other instructions for Yucatan and 
Tobasco, it will be necessary to send me a Commission and letters of 
credence for each State, the letters of credence to be addressed to the 
Governors of each respectively. 

I pray you to despatch Mr. Hammeken as soon as possible, as I shall 
remain here under much anxiety until his return. It may also be

Acting Secty. of State. 
Deab Sm 

Your communication sent by the hands of Major Ganatz suggest- 
ing the necessity of the presence of either Mr. Vaja Ness or myself, 
" inmiediately " at Austin has just been received and we regret ex- 
tremely that its call cannot be so promptly respondisd to as you seem 
to wish and we would desire. 

. As you are aware, our court is now in session in which we both 
have many cases, of importance, which cannot be neglected but at 
great loss to ourselves and clients. My own disposition, and in fine 
many other circumstances render it utterly impossible to leave town 
at present. 

We however hope that this communication which will be sent by 
Mr. Chevallia will be all sufficient to enable you to treat fully with the 
Commissioners from Yucatan and enter into any negotiation, which, 
may be deemed fit with that Gentleman. 

It is not my intention to enter into a full detail of all the trans- 
actions connected with our mission for time wUl not allow, and we 
shall be in Austin so soon as the Court adjourns at this Place, which 
will be on friday or Saturday next, when a. full exhibit of our cor- 
respondence and communication^ with Gen. Arista will be made. I 
only deem it necessary at this time to state that no treaty or stipula- 
tion has been entered into by Gen. Arista, with us, which can in the 
slightest degree dash with any arrangement which may now be made 
with the commissioner from Yucatan — whether of a hostile or pacific 
character towards the government of Mexico, and that the Republic 
of Texas, so far as our Mission is concerned, is perfectly free and open" 
to pursue any course which it may deem fit towards that Coimtry. 
No stipulation has been entered into restraining the movements of 
Texas in any manner whatever, and so far we stand in the same posi- 
tion towards Mexico, which we have always occupied 

I wiU add in conclusion from many circumstances which came 
within the scope of my observation, that whilst Mexico has not the 
most remote idea of ever invading Texas Yet she has no stronger 
inclination to recognize our independence thaji when Santa Anna 
first marched against us with his invading army. 
With the highest regard I 

remain Your friend and Servt.

Morris to Bob£rts.<* 

San Antonio 30th. of Sep. 1841. 
To the Hon. Samuel A. Roberts 

Acting Sec of State 
Sir— 

In compliance with your request that a full and correct statement 
be ma(}e of our acts and proceedings whilst acting as commissioners 
of this government, with General Arista, we respectfully submit the 
following statement. 

We left San Antonio with Dr. Bafael Uribe, the Commissioner sent 
out by Arista, and on the tenth day afterwards, arrived at the town 
of Guerrero, situate ten miles [from the border] on the west side of 
the Rio Grande. Here being received and treated with the most 
marked attention, we determined to remain a few days imtil our 
horses should be sufficiently recruited for the travel to Monterrey, at 
which place we were informed Arista was then quartered. During 
the stay at the above mentioned place, a communication was received 
by Mr. Uribe from Gen. Arista, the purport of which inasmuch as 
we have no copy, you can readily conceive from the following note, 
which we addressed to Mr. Uribe. 

[July 18,1841.»] 
To Dr. Rafael Uribe — 
Sir— 

We have been informed this morning by Col. J. N. Seguin that you 
have received a communication from Gen. Arista, expressing some 
surprise that he (Col. Seguin) should have visited this frontier in 
the character of a commissioner from the Republic of Texas, and 
requiring him not only to communicate to you the object of his mis- 
sion, but to remain here until further intelligence from (Jen. Arista 
should be had. 

Of the object of Col. Seguin's visit we presume he will himself 
inform you. That he is charged with a commission frcmi the Gov. 
of Texas, is an error, for the undersigned as you will see by the ac- 
companying passport are the bearers of that Commission. 

We do not hesitate to say that the Communication of Gen. Arista 
has surprised us, for with every confidence in his well established 
Character for ability and honor, we could not otherwise than suppose 
that the same courtesy and protection extended in Texas to his Com- 
missioner would have been reciprocated to us, not do we yet doubt it, 
when he should be correctly informed upon the matter. 

Gen. Arista cannot for a moment presume that we have in view or 
intend to broach the question of the recognition of the independence 
of Texas, or that of peace between the two Governments. These are

subjects alone for the consideration of the high powers of the Nation. 
The business entrusted to us by the Gov. of Texas relates exclusively 
to the affairs of the frontier under the Command of Gren. Arista and 
will be laid before him at such time and place as he may see fit to 
appoint. Far would it be from us or from the Government we repre- 
sent to propose to Gen. Arista or expect of him aught that would be 
inconsistent with or in the least compromit the high character he 
sustains as an Officer of the Mexican' Government, and we cannot but 
regret that he should have been induced by an erronious impression 
to delay a more immediate and direct communication with him. 
When he shall facilitate to us the means of a fair understanding and 
full exposition of our instructions, he will find that any propositions 
we may make will be within the scope of his authority dictated by 
honor, and not only compatible, but consequent to a state of honour- 
able hostility. In the meantime we will await at this place further 
intelligence from Gen. Arista. 

We will here take occasion to say that the rumours of the ap- 
proach of a Texan force, to attack this frontier are entirely ground- 
less. Nor will any party authorized by the Government of Texas 
make an exhibit or commit any act of hostility during our visit. 
Should any depredations be committed, we can assure you that this 
will proceed from unauthorized banditti. 
With the highest regard we remain 
Your Obt. Servts. 

C. Van Ness 
J. D. Morris 

Before receiving a reply to the above communication, and whilst 
we were still in Guerrero, Col. Jose Maria Carrasco, an officer of 
the Mexican army, arrived at that place bearing despatches from 
(Jen. Arista, together with letters written by Arista to Carrasco. In 
which after enjoining upon Col. Carrasco, to treat the Texan Com- 
missioners, with the most marked attention and politeness, he au- 
thorizes him to enter into a formal negotiation with us, ascertain 
the object of our mission and give us our final answer — expressing 
at the same time his full confidence in the skill and ability of Col. 
Carrasco and his intimate acquaintance with his (Arista's) plans in 
relation to this Country. Col. Carrasco waited upon us at our 
quarters, and after a long and on his part, as it seemed to us, very 
confidential communication, he desired that we should reduce to 
writing the main features of our mission, that we might more fully 
understand each other, which was done. 

Before giving you those written ccwnmunications, I will premise 
by a short history of the impressions made upon me by repeated 
conversations with Colonel Carrasco.

He is a young Officer of great popularity and promise in the 
Mexican army, and was engaged in the past year in negotiating the 
treaty with Canales and the Federals, and is suspected by many of 
being strongly inclined to the liberal side. He told us that the whole 
country North of the Sierra Madre was then and had been in a state 
of violent Commotion and agitation, that the federal cause far from 
being smothered and destroyed by the events of the past year had 
only been depressed for the moment, in order that it might break 
out in a form which would give a greater guarantee of success, and 
from many observations which dropped from him, from the high 
stations, which Canales and Cardines* now occupy, both as officers 
of that country, and in the estimation of Gren. Arista our conclusion 
was that the treaty with Canales was simply an arrangement be- 
tween him and Arista, that the federal cause which was then rather 
desperate, should be depressed for a while again to rise at a more 
favourable opportunity, under the guidance and with the assistance 
of Gen. Arista. Such are our impressions in relation to that treaty, 
but whether the result contemplated by the Federalists in its negoti- 
ation will ever be accomplished is, so far as I could ascertain a doubt- 
ful matter. The two principal and prominent characters now in 
Mexico, are Gen. Santa Anna and Gren. Arista, both men of much 
military fame, both men of unbounded ambition, both aiming at the 
presidential Chair, and two more violent opponents both personal 
and political, perhaps never lived. It is thought that the power 
and influence of Santa Anna even by the friends of Arista, is much 
greater than that of Arista, and that should no unforeseen event 
take place, that he will be the next president and of course Arista 
be immidiately crushed. But in the many changes, and revolutions 
which almost daily transpire in the Country, Arista's chance with 
but one single opponent is considered to be good. Such is the posi- 
tion in which Arista stands, with but one single opponent to the 
presidential chair, and this peculiar position may account [for] cer- 
tain matters in relation to our mission which might be otherwise 
difficult to explain. Col. Carrasco unhesitatingly declared, thai he 
himself was a Federal, and Arista would head the party, in the 
revolution, which would break out at the very first moment when a 
favourable opportunity presented itself — ^that he was most anxious 
to conciliate the frienddiip and perhaps assistance of the Texans, 
etc. etc. 

We were constantly enjoined to the greatest secrecy whilst treating 
with both Carrasco, and Arista, and great fears seemed to be ap- 
prehended least something connected with our mission might trans- 
pire, and we were requested by Col. Carrasco and Gren. Arista in our

written communications, which would of course be transmited td 
Mexico to be as mild and conciliating as the nature of things would 
permit, and by the former that it would be impossible openly and 
publicly to concede to our propositions, but that whilst a secret nego- 
tiation might take place in which all our propositi(His and plans 
might be carried out. Still that the answer which appeared to the 
world, and more especially that which would be sent to Grovernment 
authorities at Mexico, should contain a flat and positive refusal of 
all our propositions. (By the way it is difficult that a people lik© 
ourselves who have always been governed in an openhanded way, 
should comprehend the Mexican mode of doing business, where every 
thing is carried on in the dark and where no public measure is ever 
adopted, but one of duplicity and deceit.) In a few words I will 
attempt to explain. The Supreme authorities in Mexico, for many 
reasons are most' inveterately opposed to any thing like conciliation 
with Texas, and even the favourable reception of any Texian in 
whatever capacity he might go, would be considered as a high crime 
in the eyes of that Government. Gren. Arista, or rather his agent Col. 
Carrasco, was anxious to conciliate, and to accede to our propositions, 
but at the same time wishes to hoodwink his government. He there- 
fore privately entered into an agreement with us, and publicly de- 
clared his utter refusal to comply with our propositions. The truth 
is the whole Mexican country is in a perfect ferment, and on the eve 
of a great revolution. 

Arista is still doubtful as to the probable result of this impending 
revolution, and with a fair prospect of the Presidential chair on one 
side, should he adhere to the Central cause, and the absolute certainty 
of his being elevated to the highest station in the nation should he 
espouse the Federal cause, and in case of their succes& In this state 
of affairs Arista is halting, as to his decision, he is privately con- 
ciliating the Citizens, all of whom with but few exceptions belong 
to the Federal party, and inducing aitlong them the belief that he 
inclines to their side, whilst all his public acts which he knows must 
reach to Government, would declare him the most uncompromising, 
and devoted Central. Hence arises the unmitigated abuse of Texas 
and the Texans, which daily emanates from all the newspapers, 
and more especially that one which is paid and supported by himself, 
hence his refusal to accede to our propositions, and hence the great 
popularity which attaches to him amongst the liberal party on the 
frontier and his polite and kind reception and treatment of the Texas 
Commissioners on that frontier. 

You will find in the Copy of our Conmiunication, to Col. Carrasco 
which immediately follows, the propositions which are made by us.

Guerrero /wZy 26tK 18il, 
Col. Carraboo 

In compliance with your wishes as expressed in the interview of this 
morning, we will proceed to communicate to you frankly and ex- 
plicitly the business entrusted to us by the President of Texas. 

The Government of Texas has witnessed with regret the sectional 
and border war now existing and which has existed several years past 
on the adjoining Frontiers of Mexico and Texas, and which, of late, 
divested of almost every feature of national contest between the two 
countries has become little better than a system of predatory incur- 
sions and foray, attended with no other results than the pillage and 
ruin of unoffending citizens and settlements. This state of things is 
not only destructive to the interests of important sections of both 
Contries, but is derogatory to the character of enlightened and hon- 
oiirable people, and should not be allowed to continue any longer. 
Degrading the profession of arms into robbery and murder, it can 
only lead to crime and individual suffering, without tending in the 
least degree towards the adjustment of the difficulties between the two 
nations. When either party shall choose again to enter the arena of 
war, the contest ought to be a national one, and should be conducted 
in a manner consonant with the characters of the contending parties. 
Texas on her part will never vary from that course unless driven from 
ib in self defense by some intolerable conduct of her adversary. En- 
tertaining these views and believing that Gen. Arista is actuated by 
the high and honorable feelings which always belong to a soldier and 
a gentleman, and that it is only necessary to call his attention to the 
evils alluded to, to secure his co-operation in putting an end to them, 
we now propose to you a suspension of all hostilities for the present-, 
or at least the abolishment of that petty warfare, which is calculated 
to engender personal fexids and revengeful feelings that may lingw 
upon the border long after peace has been established. Should we 
meet with the same worthy feeling which has induced our visit and 
our suggestions [be] considered in a spirrit of justice and liberality 
we presume some arrangement could be entered into which would 
place the relations and intercourse between the two frontiers (even 
though hostile) upon a higher and more honourable footing; and 
which while advancing the interests and conciliating the situation of 
many, will not compromit the character or dignity of ether nation. 
War open and honourable war, we neither shun nor invite; but pref- 
erable and far more creditable it is, than the species of hostility now 
conducted. If hostile let our animosity be exhibited in a manner 
worthy of the advancement of the age, in which we live. 

And we must take occasion to say that unless some measures are 
adopted which will relieve our border settlements from the continued 
apprehensions they are under, Texas will be forced to take retaliatory

steps. Self defence and the imperious calls of her suffering frontier 
will compel her to adopt that course, nor do we use this language as 
a menace, but in complying with our instructions. At the same time 
that we propose to avoid the necessity of such an event, we deem it our 
duty to apprise you of the consequences that will inevitably result 
from an adherence to the system hitherto pursued. 

You cannot but be aware that even at the present time, a consider- 
able commerce is carried on between the inhabitants of the two frcm- 
tiers, and notwithstanding the vigorous efforts which have been 
made by the authorities both military and civil to put an end to this 
trade, it continues to exist. That it is beneficial to both countries 
cannot be denied, nor do we believe it possible effectually to check it 
unless at an enormous expense and trouble — an expense entirely be- 
yond any benefits to be expected. By authorizing that commerce and 
protecting, instead of persecuting it we entertain no doubt but that 
results of the most important character could be realized by you. 
And as it must exist why not place it upon that footing that will 
enable you to derive the great benefit which must necessarily arise 
from it. 

Such sir, are the propositions which we make on the part of our 
Government and for their complete fulfilment should they be con- 
ceded to by you every effort will be made on our part. But should 
you deem the course we propose to be unwise and impolitic, we will 
cpnsole ourselves during the evil consequences which must arise, with 
the knowledge that every thing has been done on our part to prevent 
them. Such an event we do not however for a moment contemplate, 
and shall remain,* until convinced by your reply, that matters so evi- 
dently beneficial the Frontier of Mexico, will be immediately adopted.

In answer to the foregoing we Teceived as we had been led to ex- 
pect from our consultations with Col. Carrasco, a note the original of 
which is herewith transmitted, expressing his inability and unwil- 
lingness to enter into any negotiations upon the subject. But an ab- 
solute verbal pledge that so soon as the matter could be secretly ar- 
ranged, the ranging parties who are now stationed on the frontier to 
intercept traders, and by whom our frontier has been continually 
harrassed, should be removed, every effort should be made to prevent 
any hostile movements by the citizens and that so far as they were 
concerned the trade should proceed free and uninterrupted. 

As to the proposition in relation to the cessation of hostilities, wo 
found no difficulty upon that point. But on the subject of the trade 
we found him difficult to persuade. He stated that during the last

two yean, the trade from the frontier limited and crippled as it had 
be^ had reduced the Grovemment reyenue to a large amount, that 
the town of Matamoras which up to that time had been a fiourii^ung 
and imprcmng city had dwindled away to almost nothing and that 
very little more than <Mie fourth of the revenue formerly accruing 
from the Customhouse at that place could now be obtained, and that 
hence the operations of the army had been much restricted for their 
principal support had been derived from this source. And it does 
seem to me that there is no course which this government can now 
pursue so well calculated to annoy and distress the Central party, on 
that frontier as an encouragement and promotion of the Contraband 
trade. For at the same time that we are ourselves receiving an im- 
mense benefit, our friends too are on the other side reaping a harvest, 
whilst the strength and resources of the Mexican army are being 
curtailed to a large amount. 

We however eventually prevailed upon Col. Carrasco to ccmcede 
this point, and started on our way to Texas. We had recrossed the 
Rio Grande, when we were overtaken by an express from Gren. Arista, 
bearing passp(H*ts and a note requesting us to proceed inmiediately 
to Monterray. 

An escort of eight men we found in readiness at Guerrero and in 
five days reached Monterrey where we were received by Gren. Arista 
with the most marked attention, and politeness. 

The following is a copy of a communication which we sent to Gen. 
Arista after our arrival. 

Monterrey August the 6th^ 18^1 
To H. E. 

Dn. Mariano Arista 
Sir 

We preseume that ere this you have received the note directed by us 
under date of 25th ult to Col. Dn. Jose Ma. Carrasco, communicating 
to him the subjects encharged to us by the Govt, of Texas. 

We will now respectfully call your attention to that note, believing 
that it is unnecessary to add anything to the points therein sug- 
gested. And although the answer of Col. Carrasco was different both 
in t(Mie and tenor from what as friends of Justice and humanity we 
had expected, we must be excused from any reply. 

While we may be fully sensible of the unjust and incorrect grounds 
he assumes, yet as it is not our purpose to engage in an angry and 
recriminating discussion, which far from tending in the least towards 
the accomplishment of our views, would not otherwise than agravate 
existing evils, we will without further comment submit the proposi- 
tions to your enlightened judgment. None but sentiments of the 
noblest Character and a disposition to avoid if possible an exterminat-

ing warfare, which continued and repeated agravations and injuries 
are fast bringing on have induced the President of Texas to make this 
appeal. 

What were the causes or origin of the present unfortunate state of 
things on our adjoining frontiers, it is useless now to enquire. Suffice 
it to say, that that crisis has arrived, which requires the immediate 
and remedial influence of inteligence and chivalry, or the most dis- 
astrous effects of unbridled and revengeful passions will be felt upon 
the border. To avoid, if possible, this result, is our present purpose 
and that our efforts will be reciprocated we will not not permit our- 
selves to doubt. 

We remain with the highest respect 
Your Obt. Servts. 

C. Van Ness 
J D Morris. 

In answer to the above communication, an answer was Handed us 
by Arista, tjje original of which inasmuch as I have no correct trans- 
lation, is herewith transmitted, from which you will perceive that he 
declares his inability, as an officer of the Mexican (jovemment to 
entertain any conversation with us on the subjects set forth in our 
Note. We had however long and confidential conversations with 
Gen. Arista, in which he stated that the regular troops ranging on 
the frontier had always received his express orders, not to pass the 
Rio Nueces, which he alluded to as our boundary; and never to 
molest any unoffending citizens, and that these orders should be 
enforced. But he said that for his own protection he should be com- 
peled to use every means in his power to put a stop to the trade. He 
informed us, that at present, and for a long time to come, no hope 
need be entertained by Texas of a recognition of her independence by 
Mexico, not only on account of the inveterate animosity entertained 
towards us, but because a Texas Campaign was always a sure means 
of raising money, when required by the Government. But that we 
might be well assured that no hostile operations would or could be 
made against Texas for the present. 

I was particularly struck with one thing that whilst every news- 
paper and public Gazette in the whole country were turning with 
abuse against the Texas robbers, as we are called, and urging the 
Government and people to unite and restore the honor of the Mex- 
ican arms lost at San Jacinto, not one word was ever said about 
Yucatan and Talisco,* two provinces now in a state of open revolt. 

During our sojourn, some twelve days, in Monterrey, we received 
every attention from Arista, his officers, and all the people, and

when we departed were escorted as far as the Rio Grande by an 
officer and eight soldiers. 

I feel no hesitation in beleiving that in a very short time there 
will break Out a terrible revolution in throughout the whole of 
Mexico, and the result will be the creation of a government at first 
purely democratic. 

With this slight history of our transactions and the impressions 
made by our observations in that country, 
I remain Your Obt. humble Servt. 

Jno. D. Morbis. 

I feel it further incumbent upon me to add, that whilst we were in 
Monterrey two Mexicans who had been taken by a party of Texans 
near Goliad, and made their escape, came into town. The occurrence 
produced a great excitement among the liberal party, the friends 
of Texas, and two Americans, DrsL Tower and Cottle were in a 
day or two afterwards placed under arrest. The Effect of hostile 
movements on our part upon the frontier could so far as I could 
perceive result in no beneficial effect, but would render many who 
are now firm friends, in self defence, our most inveterate foes. 
Could Matamoras be destroyed, good might result for these all are 
Centrals, and all most bitter enemies to Texas.

La contienda de que se trata, tiene el caracter de intestina : no cabe

Los males y calamidades que trae consigo una guerra, son segura-

Expedition. Our present circumstances compel us to be brief in the 
narration. 

After many unexpected delays and embarassments, that retarded 
our march beyond the time anticipated for our arrival in Santa Fe, 
we at length on the 29th August, reached a point on the Palo Duro a 
tributary of Red Riyer beyond whidi there was apparently no fur- 
ther means of progressing with the wagons accompanying the com- 
mand. Previous to this time, on the 11th Mr Howland our guide, 
was sent forward with two men, bearing a c<Hnmunication to Mr. 
Dryden our colleague in Santa Fe ; we being at the time under the 
impression that we were within one hundred miles of that city — 
judging from the infcnmation of a Mexican whom we had also em- 
ployed as a guide, who was a native of Taos and appeared to be 
familiar with the country through which we were passing. A few 
days after the departure of Howland the Mexican suddenly deserted 
in company with a private an Italian named Brigncdi. On our ar- 
rival at the Palo Duro, the commissary reported but five days rations 
of beef, other rations exhausted. The country in advance of us 
appeared impassable for waggons — and Indians in large numbers 
had made their appearance in the vicinity of our camp. Under 
these embarassing circumstances, when further progress with the 
entire command and train seemed impracticable, it was concluded 
that the undersigned, a majority of the ccnnmission ^ould proceed 
forward with one third of the escort to the nearest settl^nent to 
procure supplies and guides to furnish and conduct the troops into 
New Mexico. We left Camp accordingly on the 31st August with 
75 soldiers under the command of Capt Sutton — who with merchants 
and others formed a body of 97 men. It was our expectation on 
leaving camp that we should arrive at settlements or strike a road 
that had been described to us leading to San Miguel, in five days 
march — ^but we saw no human being nor any sign of civilization 
until we reached the Mora a branch of Red River on the 11th Sept, 
where we met with some Mexican traders. They informed us that 
we were about 80 miles distant from San Miguel and that there 
was a wagon road leading from that place to within a short distance 
of our camp. We immediately sent back two of them with orders to 
Genl McLeod to destroy the baggage wagons and follow us with all 
despatch. We continued our march and on the 14th Mr. G. Van 
Ness) our Secretary Vas despatched ahead to San Miguel to com- 
/municate with Mr Dryden whom we expected to meet there and 
to gain some informati(Mi respecting the condition of the country. 
He was also directed to make arrangements for procuring supplies. 
He was accompanied by Maj. G. T. Howard, Capt W. P. Lewis, Mr 
Fitzgerald, a merchant of San Antonio and Mr Kendall of New

Orleans.^ Our horses being worn out with long marches we could 
advance but slowly. On the 15th we arrived on the Pecos at a set- 
tlement called Anton Chico, twenty miles from San Miguel. Sev- 
eral hours after our arrival at the place, we were visited by a Mex- 
ican officer (Capt Salazar) who had just arrived at a ranch on the 
opposite side of the river with seventy armed men. He informed us 
that the Governor of New Mexico was advancing towards us with 
a large force, and had ordered him on to intercept our march, ascer- 
tain our business in the coimtry and require us to laj down our arms. 
We declined holding any communication with him in regard to the 
object of our visit, but informed him that we came with no hostile 
intentions toward the citizens of the country and positively refused 
to lay down our arms. We concluded however to remain at Anton 
Chico until we received some intelligence from Mr Van Ness, who 
the officer informed us had proceeded on to meet the Govr attended 
by an escort. On the 16th we had another interview with the officer, 
who was told that unless we received some information from Mr 
Van Ness by the next morning we should proceed to San Miguel. 
He agreed to despatch a courier instantly to Mr Van Ness with a 
communication requiring his return, and said that on the following 
day he would cross the river y^ith his men and encamp in our vicin- 
ity as an evidence that he was friendly disposed towards us. Up 
to this time no event had occurred that could justly excite feelings 
of hostility against the people we had met who had been treated by 
our men with the utmost courtesy. The provisions we had received 
had been paid for at double their customary value. On the 17th 
the officer called on us again with an express from the Governor 
requesting us to pause until the arrival of that functionary or to go 
on without our arms. He stated that the Govr was advancing at 
the head of five thousand men and would be at Anton Chico the next 
day. He left us and about 1 Oclock P. M. commenced crossing the 
river about half a mile below us. After crossing he marched up and 
took a position in our front with about three hundred men. The 
manner of their march and the position they assumed caused us to 
suspect their intentions and Capt Sutton was ordered to put his 
men in order for battle. We were at this time in a very strong 
position in a ditch on the bank of the river, from which we could 
have successfully repelled an attack of a thousand men so long as 
amunition lasted. About an hour after the officer abovementioned 
had taken his position, another body of Troops under the command 
of a Colonel crossed the river above us and formed a junction with 
the first party, making in all about six hundred men. There was

no longer any doubt as to the intention of the Mexicans and we were 
momentarily expecting a conflict, when Capt Lewis galloped over 
to us in ccxnpany with Don Manuel Chavis kinsman and confidential 
agent of the Governor with authority to demand our surrender up<Hi 
the following terms — That w*e should immediately give up our arms 
and remain at Anton Chico as prisoners of war on parole, until 
such time as supplies could be obtained for the subsistence of our 
Troops in returning to Texas, that on no condition could we be 
allowed to proceed further into the Mexican territory, but that as 
soon as provisions were procured we should be escorted beyond the 
frontier, Where the arms, horses and private property of the officers 
and men should be restored to them. These terms were offered by 
Mr Chavis, with the most solemn pledges for their fulfillment, sec- 
onded by the assurances of Capt Lewis in whom at that time we 
reposed the utmost confidence. Capt Lewis informed us that he 
had proceeded with Van Ness and Howard in the execution of our 
orders — that on the road beyond San Aliguel they were suddenly 
surrounded and taken prisoners by a large party of rancheros, were 
all tied and about to be shot, when some explanation he (Lewis) 
made caused the Mexicans to desist from their purpose and conduct 
them on to the Governor who was rapidly advancing. On meeting 
his Excellency Capt Lewis was released on parole and sent back to 
us with Mr Chavis where they arrived just in time to prevent blood- 
shed. Capt Lewis stated that the people of the country were all 
arrayed in arms and greatly exasperated against us, in consequence 
of the false reports circulated among them in regard to the object 
of the expedition, by the deserter Brignoli who had been several 
days in Santa Fe — that he had left the Governor in twelve miles of 
Anton Chico with two thousand troops, better armed and desci- 
plined than any he had ever seen, his numbers augmenting hourly 
by the accession of Militia and that in twenty four hours we should 
be surrounded by more than four thousand men. He also stated that 
Mr Dry den had left Santa Fe some time previous — ^that Howland 
had arrived in the City with his two companions (Baker and Rosen- 
bury) and after remaining a few days, had disappeared under cir- 
cumstances that excited the Gt)vs. suspicions and caused them to bo 
pursued — that it was utterly impossible at that time to conciliate the 
minds of the people in our favour and the only means of saving the 
lives of the whole party was an immediate surrender and acceptance 
of the terms proposed by Mr Chavis. 

Under these circumstances — without provisions for our men, our 
horses broken down by long and weary marches, deprived of any 
hope of aid from our main body by a distance of two hundred miles, 
with an enemy before us with more than five times our numbers and

should we be victorious in the present fight of which we had no doubt, 
the prospect of being attacked by several thousand fresh troops in 
less than twenty four hours — ^in this situation and considering that 
we were specially instructed to avoid hostilities should the people 
themselves be opposed to us, we concluded the best and most pru- 
dent course we could adopt was an acceptance of the tenns proposed, 
and consequently we surrendered. We soon had to experience a new 
illustration of Mexican falsehood and treachery ; for we had scarcely 
yielded our arms, when the conditions of our surrender were violated, 
and in fact not one singte article of the capitulation was respected, 
except the sparing of our lives and that only after a whole night's 
deliberation in council. Govemer Armijo arrived at Anton Chico 
on the 18th attended by near one thousand men as indifferently armed 
and as little like soldiers in appearance and movement as could easily 
be imagined. Tho we made several efforts, we never succeeded in 
obtaining an interview or having any communication with the Gov- 
ernor. Our arms, horses and private property were distributed among 
the Mexican soldiers, and instead of being permitted to return to 
Texas, we were hurried off on the 19th escorted by several hundred 
Mexicans and Indians, on the road to the City of Mexico. On the 
same day the Governor departed at the head of his troops and ac- 
companied by Lewis for the purpose of attacking Genl McLeod or as 
we apprehended of practising upon him the same scheme of decep- 
tion that had been so successful with us. 

It was with reluctance that we admitted suspicions of the integrity 
of an officer with whom we had associated so intimately and trusted 
so implicitly as Capt Lewis, but his treachery is now made manifest 
and placed beyond a doubt. We discovered that he had not only been 
guilty of falsehood in his representations of the condition of the 
country and the character and number of the Govs, troops, but he had 
been released from all restraint with a passport to travel where he 
pleased in the country, and a license from his Excellency to intro- 
duce any amount of goods into N. Mexico. His own admissions after 
our surrender, the intelligence we received from Mexicans and the 
change in his deportment toward ourselves were conclusive evidence 
to us that we had been duped by a traitor^ and that Lewis had pur- 
chased his own safety at the expense of our liberty, his country's inter- 
est and his own honor. This opinion was confirmed at Chihuahua, 
where we learned that Gov. Armijo had mentioned the treachery of 
Lewis in an official despatch. On the morning of our departure from 
Anton Chico, we were informed that Rowland and his companions 
were overtaken a few days previously in the mountains attempting to 
make their way to us, and captured after killing a Mexican. They 
were taken to San Miguel and shot on the 19th. Had Howland suc-

oeeded in making his way to us before Lewis arrived, our expedition 
would have terminated differently. We were informed that Rowland 
was offered his life on condition that he would co-operate in the vil- 
lainy of Lewis, but he refused the base proposal with scorn and con- 
tempt and died a brave and honorable man — his best eulogy is tho 
manner of his death. We have no time to recite to you the privations 
and indignities we have endured together with the soldiers who have 
frequently on the march been treated with great brutality. We are 
now on our way to the City of Mexico entirely uncertain as to the 
fate that awaits us. We know nothing coifceming Van Ness and his 
companions except that they were imprisoned on their arrival at 
Santa Fe. No respect was paid to Mr Kendall's passport. Mr Dry- 
den was arrested in Chihuahua immediately on the reception of the 
documents taken with us in consequence of his name being in the com- 
missicm and instructions. Messers Rowland and Workman left N. 
Mexico several months since for California. Orders have been sent 
to that country to kill them wherever found. This order has been 
given in consequence of a copy of the instructions sent last year to 
N Mexico, being found among our papers. We were informed yester- 
day that a courier had arrived from Santa Fe bringing intelligence of 
the surrender of Genl McLeod with 182 men to Gov Armijo. Grenl 
McLeod, Mr Navarro, three Captains and Surgeon are said to be now 
on the route to Mexico and will overtake us in a few days. We know 
nothing of the circumstances or conditions of the surrender but sus- 
pect it to have been influenced by the agency of Lewis. We here deem 
it proper to state that during our stay in the City of Chihuahua we 
were treated with great kindness by the Governor and citizens, and 
we are much indebted to the Americans and other foreigners residing 
there for the hospitality they manifested to us and the men. Whilst 
in that City we obtained from Dr Henry Conelley $1339.00 on the 
credit of our Govt, for the purpose of supplying the men with cloth- 
ing subsistence and transportation. Prisoners in this country, as far 
as our observation has extended, depend entirely on the charity of 
the people for subsistence as the Govt, makes no provision for their 
support. On our arrival at the City of Mexico we shall be obliged 
to call upon some of the friends of our Govt, for the means of subsist- 
ing and clothing the men. And we therefore respectfully suggest 
that Congress be recommended to make an appropriation to supply 
their necessities. 

We have thus endeavored to give you an outline of the events that 
have brought us to the situation in which we are now placed in order 
to correct the fabulous statements put in circulation by the Mexican 
Authorities concerning us, and that our Govt, may adopt such meas- 
ures as its judgment may dictate for our relief. Our present condi-

tion and the uncertainty of conveying intelligence from this country 
precludes us from presenting at this time a more comprehensive 
accoimt of the Expedition, or transmitting to your department, such 
information as we have obtained in regard to this country.

Sir, 

I have the honor, by special direction of the President to acknowl- 
edge the receipt of several letters, written by you to him, during the 
month of Novr. on the subject of a proposed secret negotiation with 
Gen. Almonte, for the cession of Texas to the United States etc,

clusion, some of which are connected with the public policy of the 
country alone, and cannot at this time be properly communicated to 
you, and some having relavence to your individual disqualifications, 
which will be given you, if requested. 

In compliance with an assurance therein given, the President

absence the duties of Secretary of State.

does not indicate how much was to be copied; but the extract was 
doubtless intended to include the paragraphs relating to Hamilton's

Houston to Secretary of State [Jones].*' 

Washington, 10th. June^ 1843. 
To the Honorable, the Secretary op State: 

Sir — You will say to our chargfe d'Affaires that, in referring the 
termination of our difficulties with Mexico to the friendly mediation 
of the governments to which they are accredited, we have given 
earnest of our desires for peace. 

If peace is not concluded before the next session of Congress, or 
Mexico informed by those powers that she must confine herself to the 
West side of the Rio Grande, Texas will assume an offensive attitude, 
with all the means she can command, and will not feel restrained 
from the emplojrment of auxiliary aid in the prosecution of the War, 
unless she can have peace or a satisfactory armistice previous to the 
anticipated foray in September. Her acti(Hi will be an united action 
and the limits of her enterprise will not be bounded by the Rio 
Grande nor any other point. The region of Santa F6 will be one 
point from which our operations will progress. Texas can and will

marshal an army there which will averrun the country dependent 
upon that point of territory. 

Mexico, or at least the North Eastern portion of it, is subject to 
constant and most destructive inroads from powerful tribes of In- 
dians. They make their forays beyond Monclova, Saltillo and near 
to San Luis Potosi and on the Lower Rio Grande in sight of Mata- 
moros. In our treaties with the Indians we have not sought to stim- 
ulate them to the massacre of the Mexicans, but, on the contrary, 
have sought to inculcate a different course. Mexico has waged a sav- 
age war against us, and in their forays they have associated with 
their regulars untutored savages. If war is begun by Texas it will 
necessarily be a war of retaliation. If another foray is made by 
Mexico, it will not be possible to restrain the people of Texas. And 
though I have heretofore sought a pacific policy, under the most an- 
no3dng circiunstances, if the war is necessarily begun again, I will use 
all my energies in sustaining it and ensuring success to our arms. 

The feeling of Texas is decidely in favor of war. I have deferred 
the measure with due respect to the powers to whom we have pro- 
tested against the course of Mexico, thus long, with the hope that 
another resort to active war would not be necessary and that their 
mediation would be successful. I yet hope it may not fail. 
I have the honor to be. 

Very respectfully, Your obt. servt..

COKRESPONDENCE WITH MEXICO. 787 

I trust that the additional instructions that will be forwarded to 
you from the War Department will lead to a consummation of your 
efforts to effect a truce. 

If it be possible so to arrange it, as to obtain the admission of the 
fifth article, as presented by you, I entertain no doubt but that you 
will do so, agreeably to the suggestions of the Secretary of War. 

I can not perceive any reasonable motive that the Mexicans could 
have in passing troops over the Nueces river. The very fact of that 
concession being made, would be calculated to iritate our people and 
render the duration of the truce more precarious than it other wise 
would be. And as it is the desire of this government to maintain the 
most perfect good faith in relation to any stipulations that may be 
entered into, I am anxious to obviate every impediment to the attain- 
ment of that object. But if nothing else can be done, and it should 
be necessary so to do, you will admit the article in question as pre- 
sented by the Mexican Commissioners, and as communicated by you 
to this government. 

In stipulating for commissioners to go to the city of Mexico, you 
will embrace orie or more commissioners; for it might so happen that 
the amount appropriated by Congress would not authorise the employ- 
ment of more than one. 

Another subject, which you are aware is of deep concern to the peo- 
ple of this country, is that of the liberation of our prisoners. You 
will perceive, and the Mexican commissioners ought also, that nego- 
tiations for a general peace, under an armistice, would progress much 
more agreeably if the prisoners were restored to their homes. You 
know that there are many men in every community who seize upon 
every pretext for keeping up excitement, which is always unfavorable 
to the attainment of the ends of peace. 

At the present moment there is a better foundation on which to 
establish friendly relations with Mexico, than has heretofore existed. 
You are aware, and I presume Mexico is likewise, that influences from 
abroad are rather calculated to excite a spirit of war in this country 
than to calm the troubled waters. If our prisoners were restored 
without further delay, it would to a great extent counteract these 
influences and produce a desire for reconciliation with Mexico. 

So far as the government of Texas was concerned, the Mexican 
prisoners in Texas were all released. There is not a Mexican held in 
bondage in the Republic. There are many engaged in voluntary 
employments, but they cannot be constrained to serve for a single day 
beyond their own inclination. Several of them are married and set- 
tled in this coimtry; and you know very well that we have not the 
power of disfranchising such as may choose to become citizens. Our 
. constitution guaranties to Mexicans the same rights it does to Anglo- 
Saxons.

Furthermore, forty odd Mexicans were captured by Snively and 
received immediate liberty. Mexicans have not only been treated 
by this government with liberality, and lenity, but when our govern- 
ment was very poor, there were no leas than two cartels sent to 
Matamoros, at considerable expense. 

These are facts within your knowledge, Grentlemen ; and it cannot 
be supposed that the Mexicans who were prisoners, and placed at 
liberty, by this government, could now be compelled to leave this 
country, after voluntary domiciliation. My proclamation offering 
convoy to all such as wished to exercise their liberty in returning to 
Mexico, was based upon an assurance through the British Charg^ 
d'Affaires that corresponding liberty would be given as well as con- 
voy, to all Texians held as prisoners by Mexico. The guaranty of 
England to this effect, I presume will be verified by the correspond- 
ence upon the subject. 

It is my earnest desire, as you well know, to see harmony estab- 
lished between the two countries. They have everything desirable 
to gain by it. By a renewal of hostilities and continuance of war, 
Mexico might obtain temporary advantage, but ultimately she would 
ascertain that she had everything to lose and nothing perman^t 
to gain. It would be as reasonable to suppose that the waters of the 
gulf would slumber unagitated by the winds as to imagine that 
Texas could be subdued and remain in a state of quiescence. 

After years of toil and suffering, and when millions of treasure 
had been lavished, the power of Mexico would be impaired; while 
Texas, (by the influence of immigration and the attraction which 
her peculiar situation would present to military enterprise, with 
feelings embittered by protracted war and its attendent calamities), 
would be a much less desirable neighbor to Mexico than were we now 
to establish and cultivate amicable relations between the the two coun- 
tries. I still hope for peace; more for a love of it, and a desire to 
see communities as well as individuals happy, than from a dread 
of war. 

Congress has adopted a resolution to-day to adjourn on the 5th. 
instant I need not attempt to give- you the detail of their pro- 
ceedings. 

The revenues of the last year have more than supported the gov- 
ernment; and though the President receives very little thanks for it, 
he will nevertheless endeavor to render the next year equally avail- 
able to the interests of the country. 

There is said to be much excitement m the United States in rela- 
tion to annexation ; and I doubt not that you have seen the United 
States President's message on the subject of the relations of Texas, 
Mexico and that government.*

To the Hon 

AsHBEL Smith 

Secretary of State 
Sir, 

A resolution was passed by the House of Representatives during 
the last session of Congress for publishing the correspondence which 
took place in carrying out a secret act of the previous session for the 
Relief of the Texian Prisoners, with the suppression however of the 
names of those persons who aided in the business and are stijl residing 
in Mexico.' 

The suppression merely of the name of Mr. Hargous would I think 
avail but little in keeping his agency in the matter unknown, since 
every circumstance mentioned as occurring in Vera Cruz would point 
to him so plainly that the authorities there could not err as to the 
individual referred to. As Mr. Hargous made it an express condi- 
tion with me, when he accepted the agency that his doing so should 
not be made public, I think our Government would be acting in bad 
faith by carrying out the resolution of the House ; and some remarks 
in the correspondence are so pointed against the indiscreet use of the 
press, too common in Texas, that the very letters would condemn their 
own publication.

It has been my earnest desire to establish with the States of Yuca- 
tan, Tobasco and such others as may throw off the Yoke of Central 
despotism in Mexico, relations of amity and friendship, and to show 
the disposition of this Government to reciprocate in the fullest 
manner, every evidence of good will manifested by the Federalists of 
Mexico towards this country, I hereby have the pleasure of declaring 
to you, and of making known to your Citizens, that the Ports of 
Texas are open to the vessels and Commerce of Yucatan upon the 
same terms as we extend to the most favored nations, and that this 
(jovt. will require of its Citizens the faithful performance of all con- 
tracts, obligations, or compromises which they may enter into with 
the citizens and subjects of Yucatan. 

Should it be the desire of your Excellency and of the Congress of 
Yucatan to enter into more permanent, and specific relations of 
Amity friendship and Commerce with the Government and people of 
Texas, I have only to assure you that we shall be happy to receive 
from you, an agent duly accredited for that purpose; and that we 
will be prepared to enter into such negotiations and arrangements 
with him, as will be mutually beneficial, and result in securing a full 
and complete acknowledgment of the respective rights of both Coun- 
tries from those who are now our enemies. 

I avail myself of this occasion to express to the people of Yucatan 
through your Excellency, my sincere wishes for their prosperity and 
happiness, and of offering to you perscMially, assurances of the dis-

I have the honor to be

EXMO SOR. 

De orden del E. S Gobernador de este Estado dirijo 4 V E. en 
copias legalisadas las dos ad juntas comunicaciones, y ^llas le impon- 
drdn del grave y escandaloso atentado cometido en el fondeadero del 
puerto de Sisal por Mr. A. G. Gray Comandante de la Corbeta de 
guerra, Austin perteneciente & la escuadra de ese Gobiemo. 

Salieron de &ta Capital bajo las garantias del de fete Estado y con 
direccion al puerto de Veracruz, el S. Magistrado D. Andres Quin- 
tana Roo, enviado & &ta Peninsula por el Gobiemo de M6jico, y las 
demas personas cuyos nombres y cat^orfas se expresan en la copia 
n". 1". Llegados a Sisal y embarcados en la barca Americana Luisa, 
que debia conducirios al puerto de su destino, la asalt6 en la misma 
bahia el referido comandante de la Corbeta Austin con fuerza armada, 
y estrayendo de dho. buque a los individuos indicados, los condujo y 
mantubo prisioneros & bordo de la Corbeta de su mando. 

Beclamado por el Gobiemo 6sta violencia al Comodoro de la escua- 
dra que se hallaba en 6sta Capital, di6 la contestacion q. incluye la 
copia n". 2"., y en efecto, & virtud de la 6rden que segun indica dirigio 
al Comand**. de la Corbeta Austin, se pusieron en libertad & los pri- 
sioneros; mas entretanto el referido Comandante Mr. A. G. Gray 
cometi6 un atentado escandaloso, atentado que ha provocado la indig- 
nacion ptiblica, y por el cual ha hecho una grave ofensa directa al 
Gobiemo de este Estado, bajo cuyas garantias se hallaban los indi- 
viduos aprisionados, casi todos yucatecos, y ofensa en fin tanto mas 
remarcable y punible, cuanto & que se perpetr6 por una fuerza aliada 
y destinada al servicio del Estado. 

El Exmo S. Gobernador se promete, que el Gobiemo de T6jas, in- 
struido del acontecimiento que he referido, hard que al de este Estado 
se le d6 la plena satisfaccion que se le debe, acerca de la cual y por la 
presente nota hace S. E. la mas solemne y formal reclamaci6n.

EXHO SOR. 

El que se suscribe tiene el honor de remitir & V. E., de 6rden del 
Exmo. Sor. Gobernador de este Estado y como su Sor. general, loe 
adjuntoe nneve doctimentos, conteniendo eon mas precicion, & fondo, 
y en su origen, cuantas explicaciones, pudieran darse para instruir 
del estado actual politico, de este pais, y de las comunicaciones que 
con referenda 4 61, ban mediado entre este Gk)biemo y el Comodoro 
de las fuerzas navales de ese Gobiemo Mr. E. W. Moore 

Poco 6 nada hay que aiiadir & las solidas razones contenidas en la 
nota oficial q. de om. superior diriji al eicpresado Sr, Comodoro c<hi 
fha. 12. del presente mes, marcada entre los documentos con el numero 
8. En ellas se manifiesta explfcitamente que Yucatan no ha violado 
en manera alguna el convenio que ^celebro su Gobiemo con el de 
T^jas en 18. de setiembre ultimo, contraidp linicamente & que bajo 
compensacion facilitase parte de sus fuerzas navales para auciliar la 
defenza del Estado, supuesta la guerra q. M&dco le tenia dedarada; 
y en ellas tambien se manifiesta el derecho y la libertad q. tuvo al 
acordar el tratado que celebr6 en 28. de diciembre tUtimo con el 
comisionado nombrado por parte del (xobiemo de Mejioo, incluso 
en los documentos, senalado con el numero 6. y relative & fijar las 
bases 6 condiciones, q. en 61 se expresan, bajo las cuales volveria a 
unirse este Estado con el resto de la Kepublica. 

Los pueblos detestan- la guerra, y solo la sostienen por repeler la 
tiranfa y afiansar su libertad. Faltando estas causas prefieren y 
apetesen la paz, y este sentimiento innato y comun forma una ley 
inviolable, preecsistente a todo convenio. 

El Gobiemo de M6jico ha convidado & Yucatan con la paz, exi- 
t&ndolo & la union con el resto de la Bepublica, y garantisando sus 
derechos y especialmente los de su libertad. La moral, la politica, 
y la conveniencia publica exijian q. se aceptasen estos ventajosos 
convenios, y asi se hizo consignandolos circunstanciadamente en d 
referido tratado, pendiente hoy de la ratificacion del Gobiemo de 
M6jico; y por lo tanto no estando aun consumado el contrato para 
que establesca recfprocos derechos y obligaciones, Yucatan perma- 
nese en esicion del resto de la Eepublica, y variara de politica luego 
q. aquel Grobierno apruebe el referido tratado, sin que por esto se 
constituya en la obligacion de hostilizar & Tejas como se deduce del 
mismo tratado, ni tampoco el que deje de dispensarle aquellas justas 
consideraciones & que inclinan las simpatias y uniformidad de prin- 
cipios en favor de la causa de la libertad y prosperidad de los 
pueblos.
