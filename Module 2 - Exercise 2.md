outwit hub scrape html webpages

For me, this exercise seemed to be pretty straight foreward, however actually understanding it seemed to be the issue for me. 

First, I searched up "pie" in the search engine:

Then, I viewed the page source:

I went into Outwit and did similar thing:

And was able to export the data to an excel file:

I'm assuming that this information can be analyzed, so I opened the excel file and got some interesting deets. 

Gives me some translated headwords, vetting status, and also some original greek. But you can also see who has changed and updated the file as well as some tweaks that certain authors have changed to the original data. This could be really useful in seeing how the information has been changed and updated -- this is useful in research and analysis of data. 

I'm not quite sure if I've done this 100% correctly so I'm going to double check on Slack(bless the community aspect of this course). 

Talk soon!


Update:
Alright, so I was definitely doing something wrong. I went to slack but ended up figuring it out myself. I left out one small thing that kinda was a big deal, the markers that were mentioned in the workbook. Once I did this, I got the correct excel file I believe. 
Here you can see the markers:

I totally forgot to put these in and once I did I got a bunch more info. 

So here is the page on the website:

There's a bunch of info but nothing really useful to me. 

Now with the excel file,  I have a file with a bunch of translations that you couldn't otherwise see on the website. It's really helpful and interesting to view all of these next to one another.
