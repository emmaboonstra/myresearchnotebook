epigraphic database commwealth graves war

I'm starting out with CWGC - "Find War Dead" 
I was curious to google my own last name, and I was pretty surprised getting some results, since my last name is Dutch.

Boonstra, Sjoerd

And lastly, another: Boonstra, Taeke

I find it kind of pecuiliar that the first and last man have the same name, died same day but have different results in terms of where they are buried. If they died on the same day and have same name, I'm assuming it's the same person. But there's discrepancies in where he is buried.
I tried to do some more searching on the web for Taeke but didn't get too much. There seems to be a lot of records for him though!

For the other database, I didn't really have too much sucess but I tried anyways, I did some snooping with objects. First I tried "figlin" but I went on to try a few other things like "libro" and "monile"-- which are book and jewel.

As you can see, didn't have much luck with jewel!^
