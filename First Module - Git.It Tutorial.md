 git.it github module1 tutorial branches forks

I started up Git.It last night and was able to make it pretty far into the tutorial without any trouble -- I had made my first repository, set up my account, set up a remote, and even done the forks and clones unit, but when I reached Branches section, I faced a little bit of trouble.  

First mistake that I made was not naming my file correctly that was in the contributors folder. As I learned by chatted on Slack, in creating and committing a file I have to match the script that they are using. So by using rtf instead of .txt, this definitely caused some issues. Here's a photo so you get the idea:

But the root of my problem was that I didn't really grasp or understand the idea of directories and folders, so I realized that I should have been in the patchwork folder, thanks to some chatting on Slack.

So, what I did was follow these instructions from dr.graham:

This allowed me to understand 2 things: 
One, I needed to add the "contributors/" when I was committing things.
Also, I needed to commit/add the file. 


Finally, I had some success:

Everything looked really good! The file was connected and I was a collaborator!
